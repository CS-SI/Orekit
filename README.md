# Orekit

> An accurate and efficient core layer for space flight dynamics applications

[Orekit](https://www.orekit.org) is a low level space dynamics library written
in Java. Orekit is designed to be easily used in very different contexts, from
quick studies up to critical operations. As a library, Orekit provides basic
elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames, ...) and various algorithms to
handle them (conversions, propagations, pointing, ...).
