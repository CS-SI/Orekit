/** Interface for providing data files to {@link DataLoader file loaders}.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines a generic way to explore some collection holding
 * data files and load some of them. The collection may be a list of resources
 * in the classpath, a directories tree in filesystem, a zip or jar archive,
 * a database, a connexion to a remote server ...
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The proper way to use this interface is to configure one or more
 * implementations and register them in the {@link DataProvidersManager data
 * providers manager singleton}, or to let this manager use its default
 * configuration. Once registered, they will be used automatically whenever
 * some data needs to be loaded. This allow high level applications developers
 * to customize Orekit data loading mechanism and get a tighter intergation of
 * the library within their application.
