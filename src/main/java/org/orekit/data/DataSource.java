/** Container associating a name with a stream or reader that can be opened <em>lazily</em>.
 * <p>
 * This association and the lazy-opening are useful in different cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>when {@link DirectoryCrawler crawling} a directory tree to select data
 *   to be loaded by a {@link DataLoader}, the files that are not meaningful for
 *   the loader can be ignored and not opened at all</li>
 *   <li>when {@link DataFilter data filtering} is used, the raw stream can
 *   be opened by the filter only if the upper level filtered stream is opened</li>
 *   <li>when opening a stream for loading the data it provides, the opening
 *   and closing actions can be grouped in Orekit internal code using a {@code try
 *   with resources} clause so closing is done properly even in case of exception</li>
 *   <li>if some pre-reading of the first few bytes or characters are needed to decide how to
 *   load data (as in {@link org.orekit.files.ccsds.utils.lexical.LexicalAnalyzerSelector}),
 *   then the stream can be opened, buffered and rewound and a fake open method used
 *   to return the already open stream so a {@code try with resources} clause
 *   elsewhere works properly for closing the stream</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Beware that the purpose of this class is only to delay this opening (or not open
 * the stream or reader at all), it is <em>not</em> intended to open the stream several
 * times and <em>not</em> intended to open both the binary stream and the characters reader.
 * Some implementations may fail if the {@link #getOpener() opener}'s
 * {@link Opener#openStreamOnce() openStreamOnce} or {@link Opener#openReaderOnce() openReaderOnce}
 * methods are called several times or are both called separately. This is particularly
 * true for network-based streams.
