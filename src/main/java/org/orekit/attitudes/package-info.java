/**
 *
 * This package provides classes to represent simple attitudes.
 *
 * <p>
 * Some force models such as the atmospheric drag or the maneuvers need to
 * know the spacecraft orientation in inertial frame. OREKIT uses a simple
 * container for {@link org.orekit.attitudes.Attitude Attitude} which
 * includes both the geometric part (i.e. rotation) and the kinematic part
 * (i.e. the instant spin axis). The components hold by this container
 * allow to convert vectors from inertial frame to spacecraft frame along
 * with their derivatives. This container is similar in spirit to the various
 * extensions of the abstract {@link org.orekit.orbits.Orbit Orbit} class:
 * it represents a state at a specific instant.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Several classical attitude laws are already provided in this package.
 * One special implementation is the {@link
 * org.orekit.attitudes.AttitudesSequence AttitudesSequence} class which
 * handle a set of laws, only one of which being active at any time. The
 * active law changes as switch events are triggered.
