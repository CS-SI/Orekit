<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p> 
  OREKIT library is a low-level library for space mechanics projects. It is 
implemented in the JAVA language. 
</p>
<p>OREKIT project was initiated by CS with the following goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
 <li>provide a common base layer for space projects</li>
 <li>support both quick developments with loose requirements and complex
     projects with rich physical modeling, fine customization, and high accuracy</li>
 <li>be user-extensible through clear and as simple as possible architecture</li> 
 <li>use unified interfaces to allow models and algorithms switching with almost no effort</li>
 <li>provide both basic and rich models that can be plugged interchangeably to ease
     applications validation</li> 
 <li>separate models configuration from models usage to hide away complexity and keep
     caller code simple</li>
 <li>support both development of standalone and embedded applications (web services,
     plugins, scripting frameworks ...)</li>
 <li>use up-to-date techniques for low cost development and maintenance</li>
 <li>remove platforms and system dependencies and leverage environment-hell
     (environment variables, dynamic libraries versions, operating system,
      filesystem layout ...)</li>
</ul>

              analytical model, even if it really is a numerically propagated one, which

<h2>3. Dependency</h2>
<p>
OREKIT has only one dependency: the <a href="https://hipparchus.org/">Hipparchus</a>
open-source library. This library provides mathematical tools for many purposes: geometry,
polynomial equations, differential equations, and more... It is distributed under the
business-friendly Apache Software License version 2.0.
</p>
<p>
OREKIT is based on several Hipparchus packages:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>geometry, which provides very useful objects as vectors
   and rotations (internally represented by quaternions)</li>
 <li>ode, which provides numerical solutions to solve 
   Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)</li>
 <li>optim, which provides multi-dimensional optimization</li>
 <li>solvers, which provides root-finding algorithms</li>
 <li>differentiation, which provides analytical computation of partial derivatives
 to arbitrary order and arbitrary number of free parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of Hipparchus is hidden in OREKIT as much as possible so users don't 
need to fully master this library. If they wish, they can limit themselves to understanding
the simple classes Vector3D and Rotation from the geometry package, and the interface
FirstOrderIntegrator from the ode package.
