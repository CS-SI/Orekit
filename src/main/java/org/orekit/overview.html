<h1>1. Purpose</h1>
<p> 
  OREKIT library is a low-level library for space mechanics projects. It is 
implemented in the JAVA language. 
</p>
<p>OREKIT project was initiated by CS with the following goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
 <li>provide a common base layer for space projects</li>
 <li>support both quick developments with loose requirements and complex
     projects with rich physical modeling, fine customization, and high accuracy</li>
 <li>be user-extensible through clear and as simple as possible architecture</li> 
 <li>use unified interfaces to allow models and algorithms switching with almost no effort</li>
 <li>provide both basic and rich models that can be plugged interchangeably to ease
     applications validation</li> 
 <li>separate models configuration from models usage to hide away complexity and keep
     caller code simple</li>
 <li>support both development of standalone and embedded applications (web services,
     plugins, scripting frameworks ...)</li>
 <li>use up-to-date techniques for low cost development and maintenance</li>
 <li>remove platforms and system dependencies and leverage environment-hell
     (environment variables, dynamic libraries versions, operating system,
      filesystem layout ...)</li>
</ul>

        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>integration based</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Taylor-algebra (or any other real field) version of most of the above
        propagators, with all force models, events detection, orbits types,
        coordinates types and frames allowing high order uncertainties and
        derivatives computation or very fast Monte-Carlo analyzes</li>
      <li>unified interface above analytical/numerical/tabulated propagators for
        easy switch from coarse analysis to fine simulation with one line change</li>
      <li>all propagators can manage the time loop by themselves and handle callback
        functions (called step handlers) from the calling application at each time step
        <ul>
          <li>step handlers can be called at discrete time at regular time steps, which are
            independent of propagator time steps</li>
          <li>step handlers can be called with interpolators valid throughout one propagator
            time step, which can have varying sizes </li>
          <li>step handlers can be switched off completely, when only final state is desired</li>
          <li>special step handlers are provided for a posteriori ephemeris generation: all
            intermediate results are stored during propagation and provided back to the application
            which can navigate at will through them, effectively using the propagated orbit as if
            it was analytical model, even if it really is a numerically propagated one, which
            is ideal for search and iterative algorithms</li>
          <li>several step handlers can be used simultaneously, so it is possible to have a fine
            grained fixed time step to log state in a huge file, and have at the same time a
            coarse grained time step to display progress for user at a more human-friendly rate,
            this feature can also be used for debugging purpose, by setting up a temporary
            step handler alongside the operational ones</li>

<h1>3. Dependency</h1>
<p>
OREKIT has only one dependency: the <a href="https://hipparchus.org/">Hipparchus</a>
open-source library. This library provides mathematical tools for many purposes: geometry,
polynomial equations, differential equations, and more... It is distributed under the
business-friendly Apache Software License version 2.0.
</p>
<p>
OREKIT is based on several Hipparchus packages:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>geometry, which provides very useful objects as vectors
   and rotations (internally represented by quaternions)</li>
 <li>ode, which provides numerical solutions to solve 
   Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)</li>
 <li>optim, which provides multi-dimensional optimization</li>
 <li>solvers, which provides root-finding algorithms</li>
 <li>differentiation, which provides analytical computation of partial derivatives
 to arbitrary order and arbitrary number of free parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of Hipparchus is hidden in OREKIT as much as possible so users don't 
need to fully master this library. If they wish, they can limit themselves to understanding
the simple classes Vector3D and Rotation from the geometry package, and the interface
FirstOrderIntegrator from the ode package.
