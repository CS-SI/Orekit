     * <p>
     * This method assumes the Field Of View is centered on some carrier,
     * which will typically be a spacecraft or a ground station antenna.
     * The points in the footprint boundary loops are all at altitude zero
     * with respect to the ellipsoid, they correspond either to projection
     * on ground of the edges of the Field Of View, or to points on the body
     * limb if the Field Of View goes past horizon. The points on the limb
     * see the carrier origin at zero elevation. If the Field Of View is so
     * large it contains entirely the body, all points will correspond to
     * points at limb. If the Field Of View looks away from body, the
     * boundary loops will be an empty list. The points within footprint
     * loops are sorted in trigonometric order as seen from the carrier.
     * This implies that someone traveling on ground from one point to the
     * next one will have the points visible from the carrier on his left
     * hand side, and the points not visible from the carrier on his right
     * hand side.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The truncation of Field Of View at limb can induce strange results
     * for complex Fields Of View. If for example a Field Of View is a
     * ring with a hole and part of the ring goes past horizon, then instead
     * of having a single loop with a C-shaped boundary, the method will
     * still return two loops truncated at the limb, one clockwise and one
     * counterclockwise, hence "closing" the C-shape twice. This behavior
     * is considered acceptable.

     * <p>
     * If the carrier is a ground station, located using a topocentric frame
     * and managing its pointing direction using a transform between the
     * dish frame and the topocentric frame, then the {@code fovToBody} transform
