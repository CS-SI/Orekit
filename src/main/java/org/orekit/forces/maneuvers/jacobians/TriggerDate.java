/** Generator for one column of a Jacobian matrix for special case of trigger dates.
 * <p>
 * Typical use cases for this are estimation of maneuver start and stop date during
 * either orbit determination or maneuver optimization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Let \((t_0, y_0)\) be the state at propagation start, \((t_1, y_1)\) be the state at
 * maneuver trigger time, \((t_t, y_t)\) be the state at any arbitrary time \(t\) during
 * propagation, and \(f_m(t, y)\) be the contribution of the maneuver to the global
 * ODE \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)\). We are interested in the Jacobian column
 * \(\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial t_1}\).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two parts in this Jacobian: the primary part corresponds to the full contribution
 * of the acceleration due to the maneuver as it is delayed by a small amount \(dt_1\), whereas
 * the secondary part corresponds to change of acceleration after maneuver start as the mass
 * depletion is delayed and therefore the spacecraft mass is different from the mass for nominal
 * start time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The primary part is computed as follows. After trigger time \(t_1\) (according to propagation direction),
 * \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial t_1} = \pm \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1} f_m(t_1, y_1)\]
 * where the sign depends on \(t_1\) being a start or stop trigger and propagation being forward
 * or backward.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We don't have \(\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1}\) available if \(t_1 \neq t_0\), but we
 * have \(\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0}\) at any time since it can be computed by integrating
 * variational equations for numerical propagation or by other closed form expressions for analytical
 * propagators. We use the classical composition rule to recover the state transition matrix with
 * respect to intermediate time \(t_1\):
 * \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} = \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1} \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0}\]
 * We deduce
 * \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1} = \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} \left(\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0}\right)^{-1}\]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The contribution of the primary part to the Jacobian column can therefore be computed using the following
 * closed-form expression:
 * \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial t_1}
 * = \pm \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} \left(\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0}\right)^{-1} f_m(t_1, y_1)
 * = \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} c_1\]
 * where \(c_1\) is the signed contribution of maneuver at \(t_1\) and is computed at trigger time
 * by solving \(\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0} c_1 = \pm f_m(t_1, y_1)\).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As the primary part of the column is generated using a closed-form expression, this generator
 * implements the {@link AdditionalStateProvider} interface and stores the column directly
 * in the primary state during propagation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As the closed-form expression requires picking \(c_1\) at trigger time \(t_1\), it works only
 * if propagation starts outside of the maneuver and passes over \(t_1\) during integration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The secondary part is computed as follows. We have acceleration \(\vec{\Gamma} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}\) and
 * \(m = m_0 - q (t - t_s)\), where \(m\) is current mass, \(m_0\) is initial mass and \(t_s\) is
 * maneuver trigger time. A delay \(dt_s\) on trigger time induces delaying mass depletion.
 * We get:
 * \[d\vec{\Gamma} = \frac{-\vec{F}}{m^2} dm = \frac{-\vec{F}}{m^2} q dt_s = -\vec{\Gamma}\frac{q}{m} dt_s\]
 * From this total differential, we extract the partial derivative of the acceleration
 * \[\frac{\partial\vec{\Gamma}}{\partial t_s} = -\vec{\Gamma}\frac{q}{m}\]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The contribution of the secondary part to the Jacobian column can therefore be computed by integrating
 * the partial derivative of the acceleration, to get the partial derivative of the position.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As the secondary part of the column is generated using a differential equation, a separate
 * underlying generator implementing the {@link AdditionalDerivativesProvider} interface is set up to
 * perform the integration during propagation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This generator takes care to sum up the primary and secondary parts so the full column of the Jacobian
 * is computed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation takes care to <em>not</em> resetting \(c_1\) at propagation start.
 * This allows to get proper Jacobian if we interrupt propagation in the middle of a maneuver
 * and restart propagation where it left.
 * </p>
