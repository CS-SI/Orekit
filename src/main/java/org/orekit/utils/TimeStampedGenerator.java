/** Generator to use for creating entries in {@link GenericTimeStampedCache time stamped caches}.
 * <p>
 * As long as a generator is referenced by one {@link GenericTimeStampedCache cache} only, it is
 * guaranteed to be called in a thread-safe way, even if the cache is used in a multi-threaded
 * environment. The cache takes care of scheduling the calls to all the methods defined in
 * this interface so only one thread uses them at any time. There is no need for the
 * implementing classes to handle synchronization or locks by themselves.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The generator is provided by the user of the {@link GenericTimeStampedCache cache} and should
 * be consistent with the way he will use the cached data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If entries must have regular time gaps (for example one entry every 3600 seconds), then
 * the generator must ensure by itself all generated entries are exactly located on the
 * expected regular grid, even if they are generated in random order. The reason for that
 * is that the cache may ask for entries in different ranges and merge these ranges afterwards.
 * A typical example would be a cache first calling the generator for 6 points around
 * 2012-02-19T17:48:00 and when these points are exhausted calling the generator again for 6
 * new points around 2012-02-19T23:20:00. If all points must be exactly 3600 seconds apart,
 * the generator should generate the first 6 points at 2012-02-19T15:00:00, 2012-02-19T16:00:00,
 * 2012-02-19T17:00:00, 2012-02-19T18:00:00, 2012-02-19T19:00:00 and 2012-02-19T20:00:00, and
 * the next 6 points at 2012-02-19T21:00:00, 2012-02-19T22:00:00, 2012-02-19T23:00:00,
 * 2012-02-20T00:00:00, 2012-02-20T01:00:00 and 2012-02-20T02:00:00. If the separation between
 * the points is irrelevant, the first points could be generated at 17:48:00 instead of
 * 17:00:00 or 18:00:00. The cache <em>will</em> merge arrays returned from different calls in
 * the same global time slot.
