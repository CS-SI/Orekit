/** Prototype frame that can be built from leaf to roots and later attached to a tree.
 *
 * <p>Regular {@link Frame} instances can be built only from a parent frame, i.e.
 * the frames tree can be built only from root to leafs. In some cases, it may
 * desirable to build a subset tree and attach it to the main tree after build
 * time, which means the tree is built from leafs to root. This class allows
 * building this subtree.</p>
 * <p>
 * During the build process, the {@link Frame} associated with each {@link OrphanFrame}
 * is not available. It becomes available only once the {@link OrphanFrame} has been
 * attached to the main tree, and at this time it can be used to compute
 * {@link Transform transforms}.
 * </p>
