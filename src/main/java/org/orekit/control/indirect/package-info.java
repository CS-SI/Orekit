/**
 *
 * This package provides routines to perform so-called indirect optimal control within the frame of orbital mechanics.
 * <br>
 * Indirect means that optimality conditions are obtained first, before attempting to solve them, usually numerically by way of some discretization.
 * A common theorem to derive such conditions for optimality is the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and its variants. It introduces so-called adjoint variables which are closely linked to the optimal solution.
 * This is in contrast with direct methods, which consist in performing discretization first, before resorting to finite-dimension, local optimization techniques.
