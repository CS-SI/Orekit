/** Galileo system time scale.
 * <p>By convention, TGST = UTC + 13s at Galileo epoch (1999-08-22T00:00:00Z).</p>
 * <p>This is intended to be accessed thanks to {@link TimeScales},
 * so there is no public constructor.</p>
 * <p>
 * Galileo System Time and GPS time are very close scales. Without any errors, they
 * should be identical. The offset between these two scales is the GGTO, it depends
 * on the clocks used to realize the time scales. It is of the order of a few
 * tens nanoseconds. This class does not implement this offset, so it is virtually
 * identical to the {@link GPSScale GPS scale}.
