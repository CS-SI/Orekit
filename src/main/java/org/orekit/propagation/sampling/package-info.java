/**
 *
 * This package provides interfaces and classes dealing with step handling during propagation.
 * <p>
 * It is used when a {@link org.orekit.propagation.Propagator Propagator} is run in
 * {@link org.orekit.propagation.Propagator#MASTER_MODE master mode}. In this mode, the
 * (master) propagator integration loop calls (slave) application callback methods at each
 * finalized step. The callback methods must implement the {@link
 * org.orekit.propagation.sampling.OrekitFixedStepHandler} interface for fixed step sampling or
 * the {@link org.orekit.propagation.sampling.OrekitStepHandler} interface for variable step
 * sampling.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both regular propagators using double numbers for state components and field based propagators
 * using any kind of {@link org.hipparchus.RealFieldElement field} are available. A typical
 * example is to use {@link org.hipparchus.analysis.differentiation.DerivativeStructure derivative
 * structure} objects to propagate orbits using Taylor Algebra, for either high order uncertainties
 * propagation or very fast Monte-Carlo simulations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.orekit.propagation.PropagatorsParallelizer PropagatorsParallelizer} class can
 * be used to propagate orbits for several spacecrafts simultaneously, which can be useful for
 * formation flying or orbit determination for complete navigation constellations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The low level interfaces and classes (<code>OrekitXxx</code>)
 * are heavily based on classes with similar names in the ode package from the <a
 * href="https://hipparchus.org/">Hipparchus</a> library. The changes are mainly
 * adaptations of the signatures to space dynamics:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>the type of dependent variable t has been changed from <code>double</code>
 *      to {@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate AbsoluteDate}</li>
 *  <li>the type of state vector y has been changed from <code>double[]</code>
 *      to {@link org.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState SpacecraftState}</li>
 * </ul>
