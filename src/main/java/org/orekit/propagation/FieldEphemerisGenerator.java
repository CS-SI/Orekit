/** Generator for ephemerides.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is mainly implemented by nested classes
 * within propagators. These classes monitor the ongoing
 * propagation and stores in memory all the necessary data.
 * Once the initial propagation has completed, the data stored
 * allows them to build an {@link FieldBoundedPropagator
 * ephemeris} that can be used to rerun the propagation (perhaps
 * with different event detectors and step handlers) without
 * doing the full computation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Analytical propagators will mainly store only the start and stop date
 * and the model itself, so ephemeris will just call the model back.
 * Integration-based propagators will mainly store the {@link
 * org.orekit.propagation.sampling.FieldOrekitStepInterpolator interpolators}
 * at each step so the ephemeris can select the proper interpolator
 * and evaluate it for any date covered by the initial propagation.
