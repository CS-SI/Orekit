/** This interface allows users to add their own differential equations to a numerical propagator.
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases users may need to integrate some problem-specific equations along with
 * classical spacecraft equations of motions. One example is optimal control in low
 * thrust where adjoint parameters linked to the minimized Hamiltonian must be integrated.
 * Another example is formation flying or rendez-vous which use the Clohessy-Whiltshire
 * equations for the relative motion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface allows users to add such equations to a {@link
 * org.orekit.propagation.numerical.FieldNumericalPropagator numerical propagator}. Users provide the
 * equations as an implementation of this interface and register it to the propagator thanks to
 * its {@link org.orekit.propagation.numerical.FieldNumericalPropagator#addAdditionalEquations(FieldAdditionalEquations)}
 * method. Several such objects can be registered with each numerical propagator, but it is
 * recommended to gather in the same object the sets of parameters which equations can interact
 * on each others states.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The additional parameters are gathered in a simple p array. The additional equations compute
 * the pDot array, which is the time-derivative of the p array. Since the additional parameters
 * p may also have an influence on the equations of motion themselves that should be accumulated
 * to the main state derivatives (for example an equation linked to a complex thrust model may
 * induce an acceleration and a mass change), the {@link #computeDerivatives(FieldSpacecraftState,
 * CalculusFieldElement[]) computeDerivatives} method can return a double array that will be
 * <em>added</em> to the main state derivatives. This means these equations can be used as an
 * additional force model if needed. If the additional parameters have no influence at all on
 * the main spacecraft state, a null reference may be returned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is the numerical (read not already integrated) counterpart of
 * the {@link org.orekit.propagation.FieldAdditionalStateProvider} interface.
 * It allows to append various additional state parameters to any {@link
 * org.orekit.propagation.numerical.FieldNumericalPropagator numerical propagator}.
