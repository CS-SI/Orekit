/** Detector for inter-satellites direct view (i.e. no masking by central body limb).
 * <p>
 * As this detector needs two satellites, it embeds one {@link
 * PVCoordinatesProvider coordinates provider} for the secondary satellite
 * and is registered as an event detector in the propagator of the primary
 * satellite. The secondary satellite provider will therefore be driven by this
 * detector (and hence by the propagator in which this detector is registered).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to avoid infinite recursion, care must be taken to have the secondary
 * satellite provider being <em>completely independent</em> from anything else.
 * In particular, if the provider is a propagator, it should <em>not</em> be run
 * together in a {@link PropagatorsParallelizer propagators parallelizer} with
 * the propagator this detector is registered in. It is fine however to configure
 * two separate propagators PsA and PsB with similar settings for the secondary satellite
 * and one propagator Pm for the primary satellite and then use Psa in this detector
 * registered within Pm while Pm and Psb are run in the context of a {@link
 * PropagatorsParallelizer propagators parallelizer}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For efficiency reason during the event search loop, it is recommended to have
 * the secondary provider be an analytical propagator or an ephemeris. A numerical propagator
 * as a secondary propagator works but is expected to be computationally costly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code g} function of this detector is positive when satellites can see
 * each other directly and negative when the central body limb is in between and
 * blocks the direct view.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This detector only checks masking by central body limb, it does not take into
 * account satellites antenna patterns. If these patterns must be considered, then
 * this detector can be {@link BooleanDetector#andCombine(EventDetector...) and combined}
 * with  the {@link BooleanDetector#notCombine(EventDetector) logical not} of
 * {@link FieldOfViewDetector field of view detectors}.
