/** This interface represents space-dynamics aware events detectors.
 *
 * <p>It mirrors the {@link org.hipparchus.ode.events.ODEEventHandler
 * ODEEventHandler} interface from <a href="https://hipparchus.org/">
 * Hipparchus</a> but provides a space-dynamics interface to the
 * methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>Events detectors are a useful solution to meet the requirements
 * of propagators concerning discrete conditions. The state of each
 * event detector is queried by the integrator at each step. When the
 * sign of the underlying g switching function changes, the step is rejected
 * and reduced, in order to make sure the sign changes occur only at steps
 * boundaries.</p>
 *
 * <p>When step ends exactly at a switching function sign change, the corresponding
 * event is triggered, by calling the {@link #eventOccurred(SpacecraftState, boolean)}
 * method. The method can do whatever it needs with the event (logging it, performing
 * some processing, ignore it ...). The return value of the method will be used by
 * the propagator to stop or resume propagation, possibly changing the state vector.<p>
