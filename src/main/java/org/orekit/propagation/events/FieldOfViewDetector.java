/** Finder for target entry/exit events with respect to a satellite sensor
 * {@link FieldOfView Field Of View}.
 * <p>Beware that this detector is unaware of any bodies occluding line-of-sight to
 * the target. It can be therefore used for many contexts from Earth Observation to
 * interplanetary mission design. For instance, in an Earth Observation context,
 * it can be easily combined to an {@link ElevationDetector} using
 * {@link BooleanDetector#andCombine(java.util.Collection)} to calculate station
 * visibility opportunities within the satellite's field of view.
 * <p>The default implementation behavior is to {@link Action#CONTINUE continue}
 * propagation at FOV entry and to {@link Action#STOP stop} propagation
 * at FOV exit. This can be changed by calling
 * {@link #withHandler(EventHandler)} after construction.</p>
