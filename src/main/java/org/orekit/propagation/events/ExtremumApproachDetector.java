/**
 * Finder for extremum approach events.
 * <p>
 * This class finds extremum approach events (i.e. closest or farthest approach).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default implementation behavior is to {@link Action#CONTINUE continue} propagation at farthest approach and to
 * {@link Action#STOP stop} propagation at closest approach. This can be changed by calling
 * {@link #withHandler(EventHandler)} after construction (go to the end of the documentation to see an example).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As this detector needs two objects (moving relative to each other), it embeds one
 * {@link PVCoordinatesProvider coordinates provider} for the secondary object and is registered as an event detector in
 * the propagator of the primary object. The secondary object  {@link PVCoordinatesProvider coordinates provider} will
 * therefore be driven by this detector (and hence by the propagator in which this detector is registered).
 * </p>
 * <p><b>
 * In order to avoid infinite recursion, care must be taken to have the secondary object provider being <em>completely
 * independent</em> from anything else. In particular, if the provider is a propagator, it should <em>not</em> be run
 * together in a {@link PropagatorsParallelizer propagators parallelizer} with the propagator this detector is
 * registered in. It is fine however to configure two separate propagators PsA and PsB with similar settings for the
 * secondary object and one propagator Pm for the primary object and then use Psa in this detector registered within Pm
 * while Pm and Psb are run in the context of a {@link PropagatorsParallelizer propagators parallelizer}.
 * </b></p>
 * <p>
 * For efficiency reason during the event search loop, it is recommended to have the secondary provider be an analytical
 * propagator or an ephemeris. A numerical propagator as a secondary propagator works but is expected to be
 * computationally costly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also, it is possible to detect solely one type of event using an {@link EventSlopeFilter event slope filter}. For
 * example in order to only detect closest approach, one should type the following :
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ExtremumApproachDetector extremumApproachDetector = new ExtremumApproachDetector(secondaryPVProvider);
 * EventDetector closeApproachDetector = new EventSlopeFilter<ExtremumApproachDetector>(extremumApproachDetector,FilterType.TRIGGER_ONLY_INCREASING_EVENTS);
 *  }
 * </pre>
