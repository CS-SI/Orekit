/**
 * This package provides tools to convert a given propagator or a set of
 * {@link org.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState} into another propagator.
 * The conversion principle is to minimize the mean square error for positions
 * and velocities over a given time span.
 * <p>
 * The conversion from osculating to mean elements appears as a side effect of
 * propagation models conversion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These package extends an original contribution from Telespazio for TLE
 * (Orbit Converter for Two-Lines Elements) to all propagators.
