     * <p>
     * This generator can be used when the user needs fast random access to the orbit
     * state at any time between the initial and target times. A typical example is the
     * implementation of search and iterative algorithms that may navigate forward and
     * backward inside the propagation range before finding their result even if the

     * target time.

     * Beware that when used with integration-based propagators, the generator will
     * store <strong>all</strong> intermediate results. It is therefore memory intensive
     * for long integration-based ranges and high precision/short time steps. When
     * used with analytical propagators, the generator only stores start/stop time
     * and a reference to the analytical propagator itself to call it back as needed,
     * so it is less memory intensive.
