/** {@link AdditionalDerivativesProvider derivatives provider} computing the partial derivatives
 * of the state (orbit) with respect to initial state and force models parameters.
 * <p>
 * This set of equations are automatically added to a {@link NumericalPropagator numerical propagator}
 * in order to compute partial derivatives of the orbit along with the orbit itself. This is
 * useful for example in orbit determination applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The partial derivatives with respect to initial state can be either dimension 6
 * (orbit only) or 7 (orbit and mass).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The partial derivatives with respect to force models parameters has a dimension
 * equal to the number of selected parameters. Parameters selection is implemented at
 * {@link ForceModel force models} level. Users must retrieve a {@link ParameterDriver
 * parameter driver} using {@link ForceModel#getParameterDriver(String)} and then
 * select it by calling {@link ParameterDriver#setSelected(boolean) setSelected(true)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If several force models provide different {@link ParameterDriver drivers} for the
 * same parameter name, selecting any of these drivers has the side effect of
 * selecting all the drivers for this shared parameter. In this case, the partial
 * derivatives will be the sum of the partial derivatives contributed by the
 * corresponding force models. This case typically arises for central attraction
 * coefficient, which has an influence on {@link org.orekit.forces.gravity.NewtonianAttraction
 * Newtonian attraction}, {@link org.orekit.forces.gravity.HolmesFeatherstoneAttractionModel
 * gravity field}, and {@link org.orekit.forces.gravity.Relativity relativity}.
