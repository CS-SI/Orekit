/** This interface represents one element of a stack used to build up {@link FieldSpacecraftState states}
 * incrementally.
 * <p>
 * {@link FieldPropagator Propagators} generate {@link FieldSpacecraftState states} that contain at
 * least orbit, attitude, and mass. These states may however also contain {@link
 * FieldSpacecraftState#addAdditionalState(String, CalculusFieldElement...) additional states} and {@link
 * FieldSpacecraftState#addAdditionalStateDerivative(String, CalculusFieldElement...) derivatives}. Instances of classes
 * implementing this interface are intended to be registered to propagators so they can add these
 * additional states and derivatives incrementally after having computed the basic components
 * (orbit, attitude and mass).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some additional states or derivatives may depend on previous additional states or derivatives
 * to be already available the before they can be computed. As an example, lets consider Jacobians
 * computation. We may managed the state transition matrix ∂y/∂y₀ as one additional state and
 * each column of the Jacobian matrix ∂y/∂pₘ corresponding to the partial derivatives of state
 * with respect to propagation parameter pₘ (drag coefficient, thrust, coefficient of a parametric
 * acceleration…) as separate additional states. Then the generators managing the time derivatives
 * d(∂y/∂pₘ)/dt depend on the already integrated state transition matrix ∂y/∂y₀ to be available.
 * The propagator builds the complete state incrementally, looping over the registered generators,
 * calling their {@link #generate(FieldSpacecraftState) generate} method and pushing the generated data
 * into the state before iterating to next generator. At each iteration, it uses the {@link
 * #yield(FieldSpacecraftState) yield} method of the candidate generator to check if its {@link
 * #generate(FieldSpacecraftState) generate} method can be called at this iteration or if it should be
 * postponed later in the loop. This allows to satisfy dependencies requirements easily.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible that at some stages in the propagation, a subset of the generators registered to a
 * propagator all yied and cannot {@link #generate(FieldSpacecraftState) generate} their additional
 * state or derivative. This happens for example when some additional states are must be integrated.
 * They are managed as secondary equations in the ODE integrator, and initialized after the primary
 * equations (which correspond to orbit) have been initialized. So when the primary
 * equation are initialized, the generators that depend on the secondary state will all yield. This
 * behavior is expected. Another case occurs when users set up additional states that induces
 * dependency loop (state A depending on state B which depends on state C which depends on state A).
 * In this case, the three corresponding generators will wait for each other and indefinitely yield.
 * This second case is not normal. The propagator cannot know it in advance if as subset of generators
 * that all yield is normal or not. So at propagator level, when such a situation is detected, the
 * propagator just give up and returns the most complete state it was able to compute, without
 * generating any error. Errors will indeed not be triggered in the first case (because once the
 * primary equations have been initialized, the secondary equations will be initialized too), and
 * they will be triggered in the second case as soon as user attempts to retrieve an additional
 * state or derivative that was not added.
