/**
 * This package provides an implementation of the Draper Semi-analytical
 * Satellite Theory (DSST).
 * <p>
 * The DSST theory, originated from P. J. Cefola and his colleagues (mid 70's),
 * describes a semianalytical propagator that combines the accuracy of numerical
 * propagators with the speed of analytical propagators.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All the references for the equations in the code come from:<br>
 * SEMIANALYTIC SATELLITE THEORY<br>
 * D. A. Danielson, C. P. Sagovac, B. Neta, L. W. Early<br>
 * Mathematics Department - Naval Postgraduate School - Monterey, CA 93943<br>
 * 1995.
