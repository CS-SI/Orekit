/** This interface provides a way to propagate an orbit at any time.
 *
 * <p>This interface is the top-level abstraction for orbit propagation.
 * It only allows propagation to a predefined date.
 * It is implemented by analytical models which have no time limit,
 * by orbit readers based on external data files, by numerical integrators
 * using rich force models and by continuous models built after numerical
 * integration has been completed and dense output data as been
 * gathered.</p>
 * <p>Note that one single propagator cannot be called from multiple threads.
 * Its configuration can be changed as there is at least a {@link
 * #resetInitialState(SpacecraftState)} method, and even propagators that do
 * not support resetting state (like the {@link
 * org.orekit.propagation.analytical.tle.TLEPropagator TLEPropagator} do
 * cache some internal data during computation. However, as long as they
 * are configured with independent building blocks (mainly event handlers
 * and step handlers that may preserve some internal state), and as long
 * as they are called from one thread only, they <em>can</em> be used in
 * multi-threaded applications. Synchronizing several propagators to run in
 * parallel is also possible using {@link PropagatorsParallelizer}.</p>
