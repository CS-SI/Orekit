 * Users will typically create one instance of this object, register all

 * measurements} with their included {@link
 * org.orekit.estimation.measurements.EstimationModifier modifiers}, and
 * run the {@link org.orekit.estimation.sequential.KalmanEstimator kalman
 * filter}. For each processed measurement, a fully configured propagator
 * will be available, as well as all estimated parameters individually.
