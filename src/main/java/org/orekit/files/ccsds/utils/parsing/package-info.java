 * This package contains classes related to the processing

 * <p>
 * The base abstract class {@link org.orekit.files.ccsds.utils.parsing.AbstractConstituentParser
 * AbstractMessageParser} implements the {@link
 * org.orekit.files.ccsds.utils.lexical.MessageParser MessageParser} interface using
 * the state design pattern, where each {@link
 * org.orekit.files.ccsds.utils.parsing.ProcessingState processing state} is devoted
 * to analyze one section or sub-section of a CCSDS message (like header, metadata,
 * data or even smaller parts like logical blocks inside data).
