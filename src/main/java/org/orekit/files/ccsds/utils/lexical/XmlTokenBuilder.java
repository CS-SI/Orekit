/** Builder for building {@link ParseToken} fro XML elements.
 * <p>
 * The regular handling of regular XML elements is to used the element name
 * as the token name, the element content as the token content and the
 * "units" attribute for the units. In some cases however the token name
 * should be extracted from attributes, and sometimes even the content. This
 * interface allows to define all these behaviors, by providing special builders
 * to the lexical analyzer when it calls their {@link MessageParser#getSpecialXmlElementsBuilders()
 * getSpecialXmlElementsHandlers} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A typical example, needed for all parsers, is to handle the top level XML
 * element. The {@link org.orekit.files.ccsds.ndm.odm.opm.OpmParser OPM parser}
 * for example would put in this list an {@link XmlTokenBuilder} configured
 * with {@code name = "opm"}, {@code nameAttributes= ["id"]} and
 * {@code contentAttribute="version"}. With this setting, when the
 * lexical analyzer sees the element: {@code <opm id="CCSDS_OPM_VERS" version="3.0">}
 * it generates a {@link ParseToken} with name set to "CCSDS_OPM_VERS"
 * and content set to "3.0".
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If multiple attributes can be used to get the token name, they are tested
 * in turn and the first match is used. This is useful in ADM files where
 * the XML elements {@code rotation1},  {@code rotation2}, and {@code rotation3},
 * use attribute {@link angle} in rotation angle sub-section but use attribute
 * {@link rate} in rotation rate sub-section.
