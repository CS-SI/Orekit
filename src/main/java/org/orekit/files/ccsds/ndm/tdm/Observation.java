/** The Observation class contains the data from an observation line.
 * <p>
 * It is not an Orekit object yet. It is a simple container holding:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>a keyword, the type of the observation;</li>
 *  <li>a timetag, the epoch of the observation;</li>
 *  <li>a measurement, the value of the observation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * WARNING. The same class handles many different measurements
 * types (range, Doppler, clocks, pressure, power to noise ratioâ€¦).
 * Since Orekit 11.0, it uses only SI units, so angular measurements
 * have already been converted in radians, range has been converted
 * in meters (according to the {@link TdmMetadata#getRangeUnits()
 * range units}, Doppler has been converted to meters per second.
 * Up to Orekit 10.x, the measurements were raw measurements as read
 * in the TDM.
