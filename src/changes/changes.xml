             measurements, improved documentation, as well as several other new features
             and bug fixes. This release fixes a security denial of service bug regarding
             itrf-versions.conf present since Orekit 9.2. Some APIs have incompatibly
             changed since the 9.X series including the format of itrf-versions.conf,
             removal of deprecated methods, reorganization of the models package, as well
             as updates to AbstractDetector, AbstractGNSSAttitudeProvider, DragSensitive,
             RadiationSensitive, and ZipJarCrawler. See the list below for a full

    It introduces several new features and bug fixes. New features introduced in version 9.2 are
    Kalman filter for orbit determination, loading of RINEX files, loading of ANTEX files, loading
    of version d of SP3 files (version a to c were already supported), on-the-fly decompression of .Z
    files, code measurements, phase measurements (but only a very basic implementation for now),
    specific attitude laws (GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BEIDOU) with midnight/noon turns, possibility to
    use backward propagation in LS orbit determination, support for any ITRF version, even if EOP
    files do not match the desired version, attitude overriding in constant thrust maneuvers,
    FunctionalDetector, filtering mechanism to insert specific decompression or deciphering algorithms
    during data loading, frames for Lagrange L1 and L2 point for any two related celestial bodies.
    WARNING: phase measurements, GNSS attitude and time-dependent process noise are considered
    experimental features for now, they should not be used yet for operational systems.

             description="Version 7.1 is a minor release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. The most important features introduced in version 7.1
             are a lot of new event detectors (field of view based detectors supporting any FoV
             shape, either on ground targetting spacecraft or on spacecraft and targetting
             ground defined zones with any shape, extremum elevation detector, anomaly,
             latitude argument, or longitude argument crossing detectors, either true, mean
             or eccentric, latitude and longitude extremum detectors, latitude and longitude
             crossing detectors), new event filtering capability based on user-provided
             predicate function, ability to customize DSST interpolation grid for short period
             elements, ability to retrieve DSS short periodic coefficients, removed some arbitrary
             limitations in DSST tesseral and zonal contribution, ability to set short period
             degree/order to smaller values than mean elements in DSST, vastly improved
             frames transforms efficiency for various Earth frames, three different types of
             solar radiation pressure coefficients, new tabulated attitudes related to Local
             Orbital Frame, smooth attitude transitions in attitudes sequences, with derivatives
             continuity at both endpoint, ground zone sampling either in tiles or grid with fixed
             or track-based orientation, derivatives handling in geodetic points, parsing of TLE
             with non-unclassified modifiers, support for officiel WMM coefficients from NOAA,
             support for tai-utc.dat file from USNO, tropospheric refraction model following
             Recommendation ITU-R P.834-7, geoid model based on gravity field, and use of the new
             Apache Commons Math rotation API with either Frame transform convention or vector
             operator convention. Numerous bugs were also fixed.
             Version 7.1 depends on version 3.6 of Apache Commons Math.">

        Use new Rotation API from Apache Commons Math 3.6.
        This API allows to use both vector operator convention and frames

             description="Version 7.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. New features introduced in version 7.0 are the complete
             DSST semi-analytical propagator with short-periodics terms (only mean elements
             were available in previous version), extension to second order derivatives for
             many models (Cartesian coordinates, angular coordinates, attitude modes, ...),
             bilinear interpolator in Saastamoinen model, attitude overriding during impulsive
             maneuvers, general relativity force model, geographic zone detector, and ecliptic
             frame.
             Several bugs have been fixed. One noteworthy fix concerns an inconsistency in

        The Eckstein-Hechler propagator now generated Cartesian orbits, with velocity

             description="Version 6.1 is a minor release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. The most important features introduced in version 6.1
             are solid tides force model, including pole tide at user choice, and following
             either IERS 1996, IERS 2003 or IERS 2010 conventions ; ocean tides force model,
             including pole tide at user choice, loading a user provided model ; simultaneous
             support for IERS 1996, 2003 and 2010 for frames definition, which is very
             important to support legacy systems and to convert coordinates between older and
             newer reference systems ; greatly improved accuracy of celestial/terrestrial
             frames transforms (we are now at sub-micro arcsecond level for IERS 2003/2010,
             both with equinox based and Non-Rotating Origin, at a sub-milli arcseconds for
             IERS 1996, both with equinox based and Non-Rotating Origin) ; classical
             equinox-based paradigm and new non-rotating origin paradigm for inertial and
             terrestrial frames are now supported with all IERS conventions ; automatic
             conversion of IERS Earth Orientation Paramters from equinoxial to non-rotating
             paradigm ; support for CCSDS Orbit Data Message ; improved API for events,
             allowing separation of event detection and event handling (the older API is still
             available for compatibility) ; merged all the elevation related events, allowing
             to use both refraction model and antenna mask at the same time if desired ;
             new attitude mode based on interpolation on a table. Numerous bugs were also fixed.
             Version 6.1 depends on version 3.2 of Apache commons math.">

        allows to avoid subclassing of events, which was cumbersome. It also allows
        to share a single handler for several events.
        The previous behavior with eventOccurred declared at detector level and
        subclassing is still available but is deprecated and will be removed in
        the next major release.

        Vastly improved performances for Poisson series computations. Poisson series are often
        evaluated several components together (x/y/s in new non-rotating paradigm, ∆ψ/∆ε in old
        equinox paradigm for example). As the components are built from a common model, they
        share many nutation terms. We now evaluate these shared terms only once, as we evaluate
        the components in parallel thanks to a preliminary "compilation" phase performed when
        the Poisson series are set up. This dramatically improves speed: on a test case based
        on x/y/s evaluations over a one year time span without any caching,  we noticed a
        more than two-fold speedup: mean computation time reduced from 6.75 seconds (standard
        deviation 0.49s) to 3.07 seconds (standard deviation 0.04s), so it was a 54.5% reduction
        in mean computation time. At the same time, accuracy was also improved thanks to the
        Møller-Knuth TwoSum algorithm without branching now used for summing all series terms.

        When UT1 time scale is used, it is now possible to choose which Earth Orientation

        Classical equinox-based paradigm and new non-rotating origin paradigm for
        inertial and terrestrial frames are now supported with all IERS conventions.
        This means it is now possible to use MOD/TOD/GTOD with the recent precession/nutation
        models from recent conventions, and it is also possible to use CIRF/TIRF/ITRF with
        the older precession nutation models from ancient conventions. Of course, all these
        conventions and frames can be used at the same time, which is very important to
        support legacy systems and to convert coordinates between older and newer reference
        systems.

    <release version="6.0" date="2013-04-23"
             description="Version 6.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. Several incompatibilities with respect to previous
             versions 5.x have been introduced. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to this
             version. The major features introduced in version 6.0 are the inclusion of the DSST
             semi-analytical propagator, an improved propagator architecture where all propagators
             can use events and step handlers, much better and faster gravity field force model,
             Jacobians availability for all force models, converters between different propagation
             models (which can be used to convert between mean and osculating elements), thread
             safety for many parts (mainly frames, but still excluding propagators) while still
             preserving caching for performances even in multi-threaded environments, time-dependent
             gravity fields, support for IERS 2010 conventions, support for INPOP and all DExxx
             ephemerides, new frames, new time scales, support for user-defined states in spacecraft
             state, availability of additional states in events, interpolators for many components
             like position-velocity, spacecraft state and attitude allowing to compute high order
             derivatives if desired, filtering of events, orphan frames, magnetic fields models,
             SP3 files support, visibility circles, support for Marshall Solar Activity Future
             Estimation of solar activity. Numerous bugs were also fixed. Version 6.0 now depends
             on version 3.2 of Apache commons math.">
      <action dev="pascal" type="fix" >
        Fixed conversion of mean anomaly to hyperbolic eccentric anomaly (fixes issue #135).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Extracted fundamental nutation arguments from CIRF frame. This allows both reuse of
        the arguments for other computations (typically tides), and also allows to use
        convention-dependent arguments (they are similar for IERS conventions 2003 and 2010,
        but have changed before and may change in the future).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >

        propagation (fixes issue #125).

        Error messages properties are now loaded directly in UTF-8.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >

        tide-free or unknown).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added orphan frame, i.e. trees that are not yet connected to the main
        frame tree but attached later on. This allows building frame trees
        from leaf to root. This change fixes feature request #98.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to filter only increasing or decreasing events. The filtering
        occurs a priori, i.e. the filtered out events do not trigger a search.
        Only the interesting events are searched for and contribute to computation
        time. This change fixes feature request #104.
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add" >
        Added a semianalytical propagator based on the Draper Semianalytic
        Satellite Theory. The DSST accounts for all significant perturbations
        (central body including tesseral harmonics, third-body, drag, solar
        radiation pressure) and is applicable to all orbit classes.
        To begin with, only mean elements propagation is available.
      </action>
      <action dev="evan" type="update" >
        Greatly improved performance of time-stamped caches for data that is
        read only once (like UTC leap seconds history or EOP).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Additional states can now be used in events. Note that waiting for the
        fix for issue MATH-965 in Apache Commons Math to be been officially
        published, a workaround has been used in Orekit. This workaround
        implies that events that should be triggered based on additional equations
        for integration-based propagator will be less accurate on the first step
        (full accuracy is recovered once the first step is accepted).
        So in these corner cases, users are advised to start propagation at least
        one step before the first event (or to use a version of Apache Commons Math
        that includes the fix, which has been added to the development version as
        of r1465654). This change fixes feature request #134.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        AdditionalStateProviders can now be used for all propagators, not
        only analytical ones. Note that when both state providers and
        additional differential equations are used in an integration-based
        propagator, they must used different states names. A state can only
        be handled by one type at a time, either already integrated or
        integrated by the propagator (fixes feature request #133).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to store user data into SpacecraftState. User data are
        simply double arrays associated to a name. They are handled properly
        by interpolation, event handlers, ephemerides and adapter propagators.
        Note that since SpacecraftState instances are immutable, adding states
        generates a new instance, using a fluent API principle (fixes feature request #132).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to retrieve all additional states at once from a step interpolator.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        Fixed wrong orientation for ICRF and all IAU pole and prime meridians
        (a few tens milli-arcseconds). This error mainly induced an error in
        celestial bodies directions, including the Sun which is used in many
        places in Orekit (fixes bug #130).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added support for IERS conventions 2010. Note that Orekit still also
        support conventions 2003 in addition to conventions 2010. However, as
        IERS does not provide anymore data to link TIRF 2003 with ITRF, ITRF
        based on 2003 convention is not available. ITRF can only be based on

        Added versions of angular coordinates and position-velocity that use
        any field instead of double (classes FieldAngularCoordinates and
        FieldPVCoordinates). This allows to compute derivatives of these quantities
        with respect to any number of variables and to any order (using DerivativeStructure
        for the field elements), or to compute at arbitrary precision (using Dfp for
        the field elements). Regular transforms as produced by frames
        handle these objects properly and compute partial derivatives for them.

        Converted Cunningham and Droziner force models to use the API of the new
        partial derivatives framework, despite they STILL USE finite differences.
        These two force models are now considered obsolete, they have been
        largely superseded by the Holmes-Featherstone model, which can be used
        for much larger degrees (Cunnigham and Droziner use un-normalized
        equations and coefficients which underflow at about degree 90), which
        already provides analytical derivatives, and which is twice faster. It
        was therefore considered a waste of time to develop analytical derivatives
        for them. As a consequence, they use finite differences to compute their
        derivatives, which adds another huge slow down factor when derivatives are
        requested. So users are strongly recommended to avoid these models when
        partial derivatives are desired...

        Added a new force model for central body gravity field, based on Holmes and Featherstone
        algorithms. This model is a great improvement over Cunningham and Droziner models. It
        allows much higher degrees (it uses normalized coefficients and carefully crafted
        recursions to avoid overflows and underflows). It computes analytically all partial
        derivatives and hence can be used to compute accurate state transition matrices. It is
        also much faster than the other models (for example a 10 days propagation of a low Earth
        orbit with a 1cm tolerance setting and a 69x69 gravity field was about 45% faster with
        Holmes and Featherstone than with Cunningham).

        Improved gravity field un-normalization to allow higher degrees/order with Cunningham and

        degree = order = 85, and for non-square fields at degree = 130 for order = 40. Now square
        fields can go slightly higher (degree = order = 89) and non-square fields can go much
        higher (degree = 393 for order = 63 for example). Attempts to use un-normalization past
        the underflow limit now raises an exception.

        Fixed serialization of all predefined frames. This fix implied
        also fixing serialization of celestial bodies as the predefined
        ICRF frame relies on them. Note for both types of objects, only
        some meta-data are really serialized in such a way that at
        deserialization time we retrieve singletons. So the serialized
        data are small (less than 500 bytes) and exchanging many time
        these objects in a distributed application does not imply anymore
        lots of duplication.

    <release version="5.0" date="2010-05-06"
             description="version 5.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. Some slight incompatibilities with respect to previous
             versions have been introduced, but they should be easy to overcome to users. Users
             are strongly advised to upgrade to this version. The major points introduced in version
             5.0 are a very general PVCoordinatesProvider interface, a new shiftedBy method allowing
             many time-dependent instances (AbsoluteDate, Orbit, PVCoordinates, Attitude and SpacecraftState)
             to be slightly shifted in time using simple evolution models (keplerian for orbit, fixed
             angular rate for attitude, fixed translation for position/velocity), a redesign of the
             attitude interfaces and an experimental (read subject to change) numerical propagator
             able to compute jacobians of the state with respect to both initial state and force
             models parameters. Version 5.0 now depends on version 2.1 of Apache commons math.">
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        a new experimental numerical propagator has been added, in addition to computing
        the spacecraft state at target time, it also computes the partial derivatives of
        this state with respect to the initial state (one jacobian) and with respect to
        models parameters (another jacobian). The jacobians are integrated alongside with
        the state, using variational equations for better accuracy and numerical robustness.
        This will help further implementation of orbit determination or optimization
        algorithms. This code is still considered to be experimental as of 5.0 and the API
        could change in the future.

        factories have been introduced for handling all data formats. Their default configuration
        correspond to the legacy formats used in previous versions (IERS format for UTC-TAI, EOPC04
        and bulletins B for Earth Orientation Parameters, JPL format for celestial bodies ...).
        Users can now add support for their own formats if they want (for example if they prefer
        using bulletins A instead of EOPC04 and bulletins B, or if they have their own gravity
        field format ...). Consequences of these changes are that the SolarSystemBody and
        the PotentialReaderFactory classes have been deprecated (replaced by CelestialBodyFactory and
        GravityFieldFactory) and that TimeScalesFactory and FramesFactory have been extended. All these
        factories follow the same generic pattern.

        changed AttitudeLaw.getState signature to use complete orbit. This is an incompatible
        change introduced to fix a major bug in spin computation for some attitude laws. The laws
        for which orientation depends on satellite velocity have a spin vector that depends on
        acceleration. This can be computed only if complete orbit is available. This change
        should be simple to handle from a users point of view, as the caller generally already
        has the orbit available and attitude laws implementations can retrieve all the former
        parameters (date, position/velocity, frame) directly from orbit.

        updated error message localization to be more consistent with Java exception. Now getMessage

        retrieve the message in any desired locale, not only the platform default one. The messages
        are also built and translated only when needed, so if an exception is triggered and

        for users that did add their own implementations, but it is
        simple to deal with (simply add one parameter in the signature
        and ignore it) so its was considered acceptable.

        tidal corrections are now available for ITRF and TIRF frames. Both frames are
        provided in two versions, the standard one with tidal corrections and a stripped
        down one without tidal corrections. A cache/interpolation mechanism is used to
        keep the computation cost of tidal correction to a minimum. With this mechanism,
        the penalty to use tidal correction is slightly above 20% in run time for a
        transformation between GCRF and ITRF. A raw implementation without this mechanism
        would lead to a 550% penalty, or even a 1100% penalty if TIRF and ITRF parts were
        computed independently.

        Improved external data configuration. The java property is now called
        orekit.data.path and is a colon or semicolon separated path containing
        directories or zip archives, themselves containing embedded directories
        or zip archives and data files. This allows easy roll-out of system-wide
        configuration data that individual users can override by prepending their
        own data trees in front of the path. This also allows simple configuration
