    <release version="12.1" date="24/06/2024"
             description="Version 12.1 is a minor release of Orekit.
             It includes both fixes and new features. Version 12.1 also includes major
             performance improvements in Orekit features related to orbit propagation,
             orbit determination, frame transformations, etc. New features introduced
             in 12.1 are new implementations of AdaptableInterval for elevation detector
             and apside detector, support for post-seismic deformation available in
             Sinex files, splicing of Rinex clock files, major improvements in GNSS clock
             modelling, new detectors for the relative distance between two objects
             and the beta angle, support for Walker constellations handling, a new
             propagation model for Intelsat 11 elements, a new solar radiation pressure
             model with cylindrical shadow model, a new architecture for tropospheric
             models etc. Finally, since version 12.1 support for Ant has been removed.
             See the list below for a full description of the changes.">

             description="Version 7.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. New features introduced in version 7.0 are the complete
             DSST semi-analytical propagator with short-periodics terms (only mean elements
             were available in previous version), extension to second order derivatives for

             maneuvers, general relativity force model, geographic zone detector, and ecliptic
             frame.
             Several bugs have been fixed. One noteworthy fix concerns an inconsistency in

        Vastly improved performances for Poisson series computations. Poisson series are often
        evaluated several components together (x/y/s in new non-rotating paradigm, ∆ψ/∆ε in old
        equinox paradigm for example). As the components are built from a common model, they
        share many nutation terms. We now evaluate these shared terms only once, as we evaluate
        the components in parallel thanks to a preliminary "compilation" phase performed when
        the Poisson series are set up. This dramatically improves speed: on a test case based
        on x/y/s evaluations over a one year time span without any caching,  we noticed a
        more than two-fold speedup: mean computation time reduced from 6.75 seconds (standard
        deviation 0.49s) to 3.07 seconds (standard deviation 0.04s), so it was a 54.5% reduction
        in mean computation time. At the same time, accuracy was also improved thanks to the
        Møller-Knuth TwoSum algorithm without branching now used for summing all series terms.

    <release version="6.0" date="2013-04-23"
             description="Version 6.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. Several incompatibilities with respect to previous
             versions 5.x have been introduced. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to this
             version. The major features introduced in version 6.0 are the inclusion of the DSST
             semi-analytical propagator, an improved propagator architecture where all propagators
             can use events and step handlers, much better and faster gravity field force model,
             Jacobians availability for all force models, converters between different propagation
             models (which can be used to convert between mean and osculating elements), thread
             safety for many parts (mainly frames, but still excluding propagators) while still
             preserving caching for performances even in multi-threaded environments, time-dependent
             gravity fields, support for IERS 2010 conventions, support for INPOP and all DExxx
             ephemerides, new frames, new time scales, support for user-defined states in spacecraft
             state, availability of additional states in events, interpolators for many components
             like position-velocity, spacecraft state and attitude allowing to compute high order
             derivatives if desired, filtering of events, orphan frames, magnetic fields models,
             SP3 files support, visibility circles, support for Marshall Solar Activity Future
             Estimation of solar activity. Numerous bugs were also fixed. Version 6.0 now depends
             on version 3.2 of Apache commons math.">
      <action dev="pascal" type="fix" >
        Fixed conversion of mean anomaly to hyperbolic eccentric anomaly (fixes issue #135).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Extracted fundamental nutation arguments from CIRF frame. This allows both reuse of
        the arguments for other computations (typically tides), and also allows to use
        convention-dependent arguments (they are similar for IERS conventions 2003 and 2010,
        but have changed before and may change in the future).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        Fixed event g function correction when starting exactly at 0 with a backward
        propagation (fixes issue #125).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Error messages properties are now loaded directly in UTF-8.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to know which tide system is used in gravity fields (zero-tide,
        tide-free or unknown).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added orphan frame, i.e. trees that are not yet connected to the main
        frame tree but attached later on. This allows building frame trees
        from leaf to root. This change fixes feature request #98.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to filter only increasing or decreasing events. The filtering
        occurs a priori, i.e. the filtered out events do not trigger a search.
        Only the interesting events are searched for and contribute to computation
        time. This change fixes feature request #104.
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add" >
        Added a semianalytical propagator based on the Draper Semianalytic
        Satellite Theory. The DSST accounts for all significant perturbations
        (central body including tesseral harmonics, third-body, drag, solar
        radiation pressure) and is applicable to all orbit classes.
        To begin with, only mean elements propagation is available.
      </action>
      <action dev="evan" type="update" >
        Greatly improved performance of time-stamped caches for data that is
        read only once (like UTC leap seconds history or EOP).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Additional states can now be used in events. Note that waiting for the
        fix for issue MATH-965 in Apache Commons Math to be been officially
        published, a workaround has been used in Orekit. This workaround
        implies that events that should be triggered based on additional equations
        for integration-based propagator will be less accurate on the first step
        (full accuracy is recovered once the first step is accepted).
        So in these corner cases, users are advised to start propagation at least
        one step before the first event (or to use a version of Apache Commons Math
        that includes the fix, which has been added to the development version as
        of r1465654). This change fixes feature request #134.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        AdditionalStateProviders can now be used for all propagators, not
        only analytical ones. Note that when both state providers and
        additional differential equations are used in an integration-based
        propagator, they must used different states names. A state can only
        be handled by one type at a time, either already integrated or
        integrated by the propagator (fixes feature request #133).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to store user data into SpacecraftState. User data are
        simply double arrays associated to a name. They are handled properly
        by interpolation, event handlers, ephemerides and adapter propagators.
        Note that since SpacecraftState instances are immutable, adding states
        generates a new instance, using a fluent API principle (fixes feature request #132).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to retrieve all additional states at once from a step interpolator.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        Fixed wrong orientation for ICRF and all IAU pole and prime meridians
        (a few tens milli-arcseconds). This error mainly induced an error in
        celestial bodies directions, including the Sun which is used in many
        places in Orekit (fixes bug #130).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added support for IERS conventions 2010. Note that Orekit still also
        support conventions 2003 in addition to conventions 2010. However, as
        IERS does not provide anymore data to link TIRF 2003 with ITRF, ITRF
        based on 2003 convention is not available. ITRF can only be based on
        either 2010 conventions for CIO-based paradigm or on 1996 conventions
        for equinox-based paradigm.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Atmosphere models now provide their central body frame.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added versions of angular coordinates and position-velocity that use
        any field instead of double (classes FieldAngularCoordinates and
        FieldPVCoordinates). This allows to compute derivatives of these quantities
        with respect to any number of variables and to any order (using DerivativeStructure
        for the field elements), or to compute at arbitrary precision (using Dfp for
        the field elements). Regular transforms as produced by frames
        handle these objects properly and compute partial derivatives for them.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Converted Cunningham and Droziner force models to use the API of the new
        partial derivatives framework, despite they STILL USE finite differences.
        These two force models are now considered obsolete, they have been
        largely superseded by the Holmes-Featherstone model, which can be used
        for much larger degrees (Cunnigham and Droziner use un-normalized
        equations and coefficients which underflow at about degree 90), which
        already provides analytical derivatives, and which is twice faster. It
        was therefore considered a waste of time to develop analytical derivatives
        for them. As a consequence, they use finite differences to compute their
        derivatives, which adds another huge slow down factor when derivatives are
        requested. So users are strongly recommended to avoid these models when
        partial derivatives are desired...
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added analytical computation of partial derivatives for third-body
        attraction.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added analytical computation of partial derivatives for constant
        thrust maneuvers.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Converted Newtonian force model to use the new partial derivatives
        framework.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Converted Holmes-Featherstone force model to use the new partial derivatives
        framework.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added analytical computation of partial derivatives for surface forces
        (drag and radiation pressure) for all supported spacecraft body shapes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Streamlined the force models partial derivatives computation for numerical
        propagation. It is now far simpler to compute analytically the derivatives
        with respect to state and with respect to force models specific parameters,
        thanks to the new Apache Commons Math differentiation framework.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a new force model for central body gravity field, based on Holmes and Featherstone
        algorithms. This model is a great improvement over Cunningham and Droziner models. It
        allows much higher degrees (it uses normalized coefficients and carefully crafted
        recursions to avoid overflows and underflows). It computes analytically all partial
        derivatives and hence can be used to compute accurate state transition matrices. It is
        also much faster than the other models (for example a 10 days propagation of a low Earth
        orbit with a 1cm tolerance setting and a 69x69 gravity field was about 45% faster with
        Holmes and Featherstone than with Cunningham).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        Improved gravity field un-normalization to allow higher degrees/order with Cunningham and
        Droziner models. Formerly, the coefficients computation underflowed for square fields
        degree = order = 85, and for non-square fields at degree = 130 for order = 40. Now square
        fields can go slightly higher (degree = order = 89) and non-square fields can go much
        higher (degree = 393 for order = 63 for example). Attempts to use un-normalization past
        the underflow limit now raises an exception.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Updated Orekit to version 3.1.1 of Apache Commons Math.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added support for time-dependent gravity fields. All recent gravity
        fields include time-dependent coefficients (linear trends and pulsations
        at several different periods). They are now properly handled by Orekit.
        For comparison purposes, it is still possible to retrieve only the constant
        part of a field even if the file contains time-dependent coefficients too.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Added a way to speed up parsing and reduce memory consumption when
        loading gravity fields. Now the user can specify the maximal degree
        and order before reading the file.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        The EGM gravity field reader did not complain when files with missing
        coefficients were provided, even when asked to complain.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        Fixed serialization of all predefined frames. This fix implied
        also fixing serialization of celestial bodies as the predefined
        ICRF frame relies on them. Note for both types of objects, only
        some meta-data are really serialized in such a way that at
        deserialization time we retrieve singletons. So the serialized
        data are small (less than 500 bytes) and exchanging many time
        these objects in a distributed application does not imply anymore
        lots of duplication.

             description="version 5.0 is a major release of Orekit. It introduces several new
             features and bug fixes. Some slight incompatibilities with respect to previous
             versions have been introduced, but they should be easy to overcome to users. Users
             are strongly advised to upgrade to this version. The major points introduced in version
             5.0 are a very general PVCoordinatesProvider interface, a new shiftedBy method allowing
             many time-dependent instances (AbsoluteDate, Orbit, PVCoordinates, Attitude and SpacecraftState)
             to be slightly shifted in time using simple evolution models (keplerian for orbit, fixed
             angular rate for attitude, fixed translation for position/velocity), a redesign of the
             attitude interfaces and an experimental (read subject to change) numerical propagator
             able to compute jacobians of the state with respect to both initial state and force
             models parameters. Version 5.0 now depends on version 2.1 of Apache commons math.">
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        a new experimental numerical propagator has been added, in addition to computing
        the spacecraft state at target time, it also computes the partial derivatives of
        this state with respect to the initial state (one jacobian) and with respect to
        models parameters (another jacobian). The jacobians are integrated alongside with
        the state, using variational equations for better accuracy and numerical robustness.
        This will help further implementation of orbit determination or optimization
        algorithms. This code is still considered to be experimental as of 5.0 and the API
        could change in the future.

        change introduced to fix a major bug in spin computation for some attitude laws. The laws
        for which orientation depends on satellite velocity have a spin vector that depends on
        acceleration. This can be computed only if complete orbit is available. This change
        should be simple to handle from a users point of view, as the caller generally already
        has the orbit available and attitude laws implementations can retrieve all the former

        updated error message localization to be more consistent with Java exception. Now getMessage

             simplifies interoperability with legacy systems and helps migrating from this

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved user-friendliness of the AbsoluteDate class by adding several
        new constructors and methods for common cases. It is in particular now possible
        to use offsets within a time scale, for example to build a date given as a
        fractional number of days since a reference date in UTC, explicitly ignoring
        intermediate leap seconds.

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved the class handling date/time components: added a constructor to allow building
        from an offset with respect to a reference epoch, implemented Comparable interface and
        added equals and hashCode methods.

        Improved the class handling date components: added a constructor to allow building
        from any reference epoch, not only J2000.0 (thus simplifying use of modified julian day),
        added getMJD() method, added several constants JULIAN_EPOCH, MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH,
        FIFTIES_EPOCH, GPS_EPOCH, J2000_EPOCH and JAVA_EPOCH.
