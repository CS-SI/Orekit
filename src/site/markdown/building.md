# Building Orekit

Orekit can be built from source using several different tools.
  
All these tools are Java based and can run on many different operating
systems, including Unix, GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Some GNU/Linux
distributions provide these tools in their packages repositories.

## Building with Maven 3

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is a build tool that goes far beyond
simply compiling and packaging a product. It is also able to resolve
dependencies (including downloading the appropriate versions from the public
repositories), to run automated tests, to launch various checking tools and
to create a web site for a project. It runs on any platform supporting Java.
  
For systems not providing maven as a package, maven can be
[downloaded](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) from its site at the
Apache Software Foundation. This site also explains the
installation procedure.

As with all maven enabled projects, building official released versions of
Orekit is straightforward (see below for the special case of development versions),
simply run:

    mvn assembly:single

The preceding command will perform all dependencies retrieval, compilation,
tests and packaging for you. At the end, it will create several files named
target/orekit-x.y.jar where x.y is the version number.

This command should always work for released Orekit versions as they
always depend only on released Apache Commons Math versions. Maven knows how
to download the pre-built binary for released Apache Commons Math versions.
The previous command may not work for development Orekit versions as they
may depend on unreleased Apache Commons Math versions. Maven cannot download
pre-built binaries for unreleased Apache Commons Math versions as none are
publicly available. In this case the command above will end with an error message
like:

    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project orekit: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.orekit:orekit:jar:7.1-SNAPSHOT: Could not find artifact org.apache.commons:commons-math3:jar:3.6-SNAPSHOT

In this case, you should build the missing Apache Commons Math artifact and
install it in your local maven repository beforehand. This is done by cloning
the Apache Commons Math source (using the MATH_3_X branch) from Apache git
repository in some temporary folder and install it with maven. This is done by
running the commands below (using Linux command syntax):

    git clone --branch MATH_3_X https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-math.git
    cd commons-math
    mvn install

Once the Apache Commons Math development version has been installed locally using
the previous commands, you can delete the cloned folder if you want. You can then
attempt again the mvn command at Orekit level, this time it should succeed as the
necessary artifact is now locally available.

If you need to configure a proxy server for dependencies retrieval, see
the [Guide to using proxies](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html)
page at the maven site.

If you already use maven for your own projects (or simply eclipse, see
below), you may want to install Orekit in your local maven repository. This is done
with the following command:

    mvn install

For other commands like generating the site, or generating the
[checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/),
[findbugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) or
[jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) reports, see the maven
plugins documentation at [maven site](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html).

## Building with Eclipse

[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is a very rich Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). It is a huge product and not a simple build tool.

For systems not providing eclipse as a package, it can be downloaded from its
site at the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

The simplest way to use Orekit with Eclipse is to follow these steps:

  * unpack the distribution inside your Eclipse workspace

  * create a new java project from existing sources and direct Eclipse to the
     directory where you unpacked Orekit

  * set the source folders to
    * orekit/src/main/java
    * orekit/src/test/java
    * orekit/src/tutorials/java
	* orekit/src/main/resources
    * orekit/src/test/resources
    * orekit/src/tutorials/resources

    in the source tab of the Configure Build Path dialog

  * set the external libraries to JRE system library (provided by Eclipse),
    Junit 4.x (provided by Eclipse) and Apache Commons Math (available at
    Apache Software Foundation Commons Math
    [downloads page](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi))
    in the libraries tab of the Configure Build Path dialog
