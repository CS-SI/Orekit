# Integration in other languages

The Orekit library can be accessed from other languages, for integration into existing
software or for quick prototyping in a scripting language such as Jython, Python or
Matlab. This allows for direct interaction with the different objects, either from a
script or directly at the command prompt, and quick access to plotting tools.
