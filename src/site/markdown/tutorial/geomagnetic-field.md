# Geomagnetic Field

This tutorial shows how to use the Geomagnetic Field Model.

## Introduction

Orekit provides an easy to use class for calculating the geomagnetic field of the earth.
Currently there is support for two different models:

* WMM: [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml)
* IGRF: [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html)

## Prerequisites

A geomagnetic field model relies on published coefficients files that are loaded on demand.
There exist different formats for these files, but orekit uses a modified version, which may
contain coefficients from multiple epochs inside one file.

The format of the expected model file is as follows:

      {model name} {epoch} {nMax} {nMaxSec} {nMax3} {validity start} {validity end} {minAlt} {maxAlt} {model name} {line number}
    {n} {m} {gnm} {hnm} {dgnm} {dhnm} {model name} {line number}

Example:

       WMM2010  2010.00 12 12  0 2010.00 2015.00   -1.0  600.0          WMM2010   0
    1  0  -29496.6       0.0      11.6       0.0                        WMM2010   1
    1  1   -1586.3    4944.4      16.5     -25.9                        WMM2010   2

The latest coefficient files for IGRF and WMM can be found in attachment.

## Basic Use

To calculate the geomagnetic field of a specified geodetic location and altitude is
pretty much straight-forward.

First retrieve the geomagnetic field model for a desired year (e.g. WMM):

    GeoMagneticField model = GeoMagneticFieldFactory.getWMM(2012.0);

The year has to be specified as a decimal year, which can be converted from a julian
date like this:

    double year = GeoMagneticField.getDecimalYear(2012, 6, 1);

Finally we can calculate the magnetic field at a geodetic location (lat/lon in deg) and
altitude (in km):

    GeoMagneticElements result = model.calculateField(80.0, 0.0, 100.0);

The result contains the seven magnetic components:

* F - Total Intensity of the geomagnetic field
* H - Horizontal Intensity of the geomagnetic field
* X - North Component of the geomagnetic field
* Y - East Component of the geomagnetic field
* Z - Vertical Component of the geomagnetic field
* I (DIP) - Geomagnetic Inclination
* D (DEC) - Geomagnetic Declination (Magnetic Variation)
