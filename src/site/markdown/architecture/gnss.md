# GNSS

The `org.orekit.gnss` is an independent package providing classes to handle classical GNSS files
(SEM and YUMA almanacs, Rinex and Antex) and attitude providers for navigation satellites.

## Attitudes

Several classes have been implemented in order to represent navigation satellites attitude modeling.

### Beidou attitude

* BeidouGEO, which represents an attitude providers for Beidou geostationary
  orbit navigation satellites.

* BeidouIGSO, which represents an attitude providers for Beidou inclined
  geosynchronous orbit navigation satellites. This mode is in fact similar
  to Beidou MEO.

* BeidouMeo, which represents an attitude providers for Beidou
  Medium Earth Orbit navigation satellites.

### Galileo attitude

* Galileo, which represents an attitude providers for Galileo
  navigation satellites.

### Generic GNSS attitude

* GenericGNSS, this attitude mode can be used for navigation satellites for which
  no specialized model is known.

### Glonass attitude

* Glonass, which represents an attitude providers for Glonass
  navigation satellites.

### GPS attitude

* GPSBlockIIA, which represents an attitude providers for GPS block IIR
  navigation satellites.

* GPSBlockIIF, which represents an attitude providers for GPS block IIF
  navigation satellites.

* GPSBlockIIR, which represents an attitude providers for GPS block IIR
  navigation satellites.

## GNSS data

Several classes have been implemented in order to load and handle classical navigation files.

### Supported navigation files

Several file formats are supported in Orekit.

* RinexLoader, which represents a loader for Rinex measurements files.
  The supported versions are: 2.00, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.20,  3.00, 3.01, 3.02, and 3.03.
  Versions 2.12 and 2.20 are unofficial versions, whereas the other are official version.

* AntexLoader, which represents a loader for antex files.

* SEMParser, which represents a loader for SEM almanac files. This class provides
  the `GPSAlmanac` used to build the `GPSPropagator`.

* YUMAParser, which represents a loader for YUMA almanac files. Such as for the SEMParser,
  this class provides the `GPSAlmanac` used to build the `GPSPropagator`.

### Data management

Several classes have been implemented to provide a link between navigation files
and the specialized orbit propagators for GNSS constellations. These classes,
are the base classes to build the specialized GNSS orbit propagators.

## Antenna

Orekit provides classes related to receiver and satellites antenna modeling.
