# Contributing to Orekit

Orekit is free software, which means you can use the source code as you wish,
without charges, in your applications, and that you can improve it and have
your improvements included in the next mainstream release.

If you are interested in participating in the development effort,
subscribe to the mailing lists and step up to discuss it. The
larger the community is, the better Orekit will be. The main
rule is that everything intended to be included in Orekit core must
be distributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
