# Contributing to Orekit

Orekit is free software, which means you can use the source code as you wish,
without charges, in your applications, and that you can improve it and have
your improvements included in the next mainstream release.

Considering contributing? **Great! A warm thank you to you!** We are always
happy to have new contributors join our community and help us improve Orekit.
This document is intended to help you take your first steps in the project.

You can contribute in many ways:

* [Participate in the discussions on the forum](#participate)
* [Report bugs or feature requests](#report-bugs)
* [Improve the documentation](#improve-documentation)
* [Improve or extend the source code](#improve-source-code)

<span id="participate">**Participate in the discussions on the forum**</span>

You can participate in discussions on the [forum](https://forum.orekit.org/),
share your experience with Orekit or in space flight dynamics, provide help to
less experienced users, or simply explain the features you miss in Orekit.

We want everyone to have a good experience from their interactions with the
Orekit community. Please be welcoming, cordial and caring. Avoid insulting or
derogatory language, or other conduct which could reasonably be considered
inappropriate in a professional setting.

<span id="report-bugs">**Report bugs or feature requests**</span>

You can report bugs in our
[bug tracking system](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit/-/issues). If
you have trouble qualifying the problem, talk about it on the
[forum](https://forum.orekit.org/) first. **And remember: the more information
the community get, the easier the community can reproduce and fix it.**

The bug tracking system is also the right place to report your feature
requests. We do not promise to take them into account, and even less to do it
quickly, because we have limited human resources and our own priorities. But
by expressing your needs in the tracking system, you leave a record of them
and a contributor will be able to implement the feature when he or she will be
available.

<span id="improve-documentation">**Improve the documentation**</span>

You can help us improving the [existing documentation](index.html) or you can
write a new [tutorial](https://www.orekit.org/doc-tutorials.html), to help
users to better understand the use of some features.

Except for the tutorials, all the documentation is embedded with the source
code. You can find it in the
[src/site](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit/-/tree/develop/src/site)
directory of the Orekit source code repository. This documentation uses the
Markdown lightweight text format. It is integrated with the source code to
ensure its consistency with the source code version. Therefore, to contribute
to the documentation, you should proceed as if you were contributing to the
source code (see next point), but without having to write tests. ;)

If you want to enhance a tutorial or write a new one, please note that these
are managed in a dedicated project named
[Orekit tutorials](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit-tutorials),
available on our Gitlab forge. We invite you to read the
[specific contributing guide](https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-tutorials-development/contributing.html)
for these tutorials.

<span id="improve-source-code">**Improve or extend the source code**</span>

You can provide us with a patch fixing a bug, improving an existing function
or implementing a new one.

If your contribution is minor and does neither affect the API nor the
architecture of Orekit, get started right away, following the recommendations
below in this guide. In all other cases, start by presenting the contribution
you plan to make on the [forum](https://forum.orekit.org/). The core team will
be able to analyze your proposal and confirm that it is compatible with the
objective and scope of the project, as well as with in progress and planned
developments. It will also prevent you from starting work that others are
already doing. This dialogue contributes to the smooth running of the project.
Even the core team members go through this exercise before launching into
a major contribution.

As Orekit is used for operational purposes, we want its source code to be
efficient, reliable, robust and easy to maintain. The code quality is even
a priority for us. We therefore strongly encourage you to read our
[development guidelines](https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-development/guidelines.html).

We use a set of tools (CheckStyle, SpotBugs, SonarQube...) that check
compliance with our coding rules and perform static analysis of the source
code. This verification is carried out by the continuous integration process.
The [code quality report](https://sonar.orekit.org/dashboard?id=orekit%3Aorekit)
is established by SonarQube. Since using CheckStyle in Eclipse and configuring
SonarQube to take your project into account is not trivial, you will find
detailed instructions about them in this guide. We know that these "details"
may seem boring, but the quality of the source code determines the difficulty
the community will have in maintaining it. Therefore code quality is checked
before accepting contributions.

Are you ready to go? Great!

Here's how to make your first contribution:

1. Connect to the [Orekit forge](https://gitlab.orekit.org/users/sign_in). By
   default, to limit spam, you can only authenticate using your account on any
   of the Github, Gitlab.com or BitBucket platforms. If this bothers you,
   please [let us know](mailto:contact@orekit.org) and we will create a local
   account for you.

2. Create your own copy of the repository (i.e. "Fork the repository") on our
   forge by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right of the Orekit
   repository. This is the red rectangle on the following image:

     ![fork](./images/orekit-fork.png)

3. Clone **your** repository on your workstation and checkout the **develop**
   branch.

4. Within your checked out repository, configure your username and email address so your contributions can be properly submitted:
    ```
    git config user.name "First Last"
    git config user.email "address@domain.tld"
    ```  
   
5. Create a new branch on your fork.

   The branch must have a name related to the future contribution.  
   For instance, if you want to correct an issue, the name must be **issue-XXX** where **XXX** represents the issue number.

   If you are contributing a new feature or are correcting a bug that will need an API change, have the **develop** branch as the source branch.  
   Your contribution will be eligible for a minor version or major version (if API is changed).
   
   **Important note:**  
   If you are correcting a bug with no API change needed, have the latest **release-X.Y** branch as the source branch.  
   Your contribution will be eligible for a patch version.  
   Patch versions are released more often and it really simplifies the work of the release manager if you start from the latest release branch.

6. Be sure to activate checkstyle (use the **checkstyle.xml** file at the root
    of the project) to help you follow the coding rules of Orekit (see
    examples below).

7. Perform your development and validation.

8. Update the **changes.xml** file in *src/changes/* directory (see former
    entries to help you).  
   *Note*: do this only if your work is planned for a minor/major version.  
   If your contribution can be added to a patch version, then the release manager will update the changes.xml file.  
   This file is a big source of merge conflicts so it's much easier to handle it in a go when doing the release.  
   See point 5 for the differences between minor/major versions and patch versions.

9. Run all Orekit tests to ensure everything works.

10. Commit your code on your branch and push it to Gitlab (you can make several
    local commits and push them at once).

11. Submit a merge request (a "MR" in the Gitlab jargon) on the forge, by
    clicking on the *New merge request* button:

    ![merge requests](./images/merge-requests.png)

    Gitlab will ask you for the source repository and branch (select your fork
    and working branch) and the target repository and branch (select Orekit
    official repository an the **develop** branch). Be sure that the target of
    your request is the **develop** branch of the official repository.

12. Gitlab notifies the core team members of your merge request. One of them
    will review it as soon as he or she can. If your contribution seems to
    meet the project's expectations, he or she will accept it. If not, he or
    she will explain to you how it could be improved. You can then enhance
    your contribution and push new commits, which will be automatically added
    to the current merge request.

If you have any question during your contribution you can also visit the forum
and ask them. The larger the community is, the better Orekit will be. The main
rule is that everything intended to be included in Orekit core must be
distributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.

## Configure Orekit checkstyle

Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that is
compliant with a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java
code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal
for projects that want to enforce a coding standard.

### Verify checkstyle using Maven

Checkstyle violations can be quickly verified in a Linux terminal by using
Maven commands. Contributors can execute the following command in the same
folder as the `pom.xml` file:

    mvn checkstyle:check findbugs:check test

Note that this command is also used to check that no Spotbugs warning were
created (`findbugs:check`) and that the tests are running correctly (`test`).

### Configure checkstyle in Eclipse

Configuring checkstyle can be a difficult task when installing Orekit in an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). However, it is an important step for
contributing to the library.
Here are the steps you will need to follow to configure checkstyle in Eclipse.

#### Installing Eclipse Checkstyle plugin.

In your Eclipse IDE, select *Help* -> *Install New Software...*

Pressing the *Add...* button at the top right of the install wizard will
display a small popup asking for the name and location of a new software site.

* Name = Checkstyle
* Location = https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs-update-site

Press *Add* to close the popup.

Select *Checkstyle* in the *Install* window and click on *Next >*. Proceed to
the end of the wizard, accepting the licenses of the plugin and installing it.

#### Configuring the project.

To create the local configuration, select *Properties* by right-clicking in
the context menu of the project explorer panel.

In the *Properties* popup, select *Checkstyle* entry.

In this second popup (i.e. *Local Check Configurations*) define a project
relative configuration as presented in the figure below. Browse the workspace
to select your checkstyle.xml file, and tick the *Protect Checkstyle
configuration file* check box to prevent the plugin from altering the
configuration.

![checkstyle-plugin](./images/project-checkstyle-configuration.png).

The property must be defined by pressing the *Additional properties...*
button, which will trigger yet another popup into which the property can be
configured as shown below.

![additional-properties](./images/additional-properties.png)

Pressing the OK button in the last open popup ends the local check
configuration creation. Select the *Main* tab in the first popup, which should
still be opened.

In the *Main* tab, un-tick the *Use simple configuration* checkbox at the top
right. A few buttons should appear, allowing to remove the default Sun checks
global configuration (selecting it and pressing the *Remove* button) and add
our local configuration instead (pressing the *Add...* button). Using for
example **src/main/java/.*\.java** will apply checkstyle only to the files in
the **src/main/java** directory and not to the files in the **src/test/java**
directory.

![main-checkstyle-configuration](./images/main-checkstyle-configuration.png)

Press *OK* and *Apply and Close* to finish the installation.

#### Activate the checkstyle

Select *Checkstyle* -> *Activate Checkstyle* by right-clicking in the context
menu of the project explorer panel.

### Configure checkstyle in Intellij

As in Eclipse IDE, configuring checkstyle in Intellij IDE can be difficult. Here are the steps you
will need to follow to configure checkstyle in Intellij IDE.

#### Installing Intellij Checkstyle plugin.

In your Intellij IDE, select *File* -> *Settings* -> *Plugins* -> *Marketplace*

* Name = CheckStyle-IDEA
* Location = https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea

Once installed, restart IDE

#### Configuring the project.

Select *File* -> *Settings* -> *Tools* -> *Checkstyle*

![main-checkstyle-configuration-intellij](./images/main-checkstyle-configuration-intellij.png)

Press the "+" icon to add a new configuration. A new window will popup. Fill it in as shown below by using
your own location for Orekit's *checkstyle.xml* file.

![project-checkstyle-configuration-intellij](./images/project-checkstyle-configuration-intellij.png)

Press *Next*. A new window will popup to configure the *checkstyle.header.file*.
The value is equal to *license-header.txt* as presented below.

![additional-properties-intellij](./images/additional-properties-intellij.png)

Press *Finish*.

The checkstyle configuration is almost finished. In the main configuration tab, the last
step to perform are:

1. Select *Orekit Checkstyle* as *Active*.
2. Verify that *Scan Scope* is equal to *Only Java sources (but not tests)*.
3. The *Checkstyle version* shall be equal to the version used by the project. The current version of checkstyle in 
   Orekit is available in the [pom.xml](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit/-/blob/master/pom.xml) file.

![properties-checkstyle-intellij](./images/properties-checkstyle-intellij.png)

Press *Apply* and *OK* to finish the installation. The checkstyle is automatically activated.

## Configure SonarQube

In order for SonarQube to check the quality of your source code, you must
initialize the project in SonarQube. Here is how to do it.

1. Connect to [our SonarQube instance](https://sonar.orekit.org/) using your
   Gitlab account.

2. The first time you log in, SonarQube will prompt you to generate a token.
   Generate it and keep it safe on your workstation. If you did not do so the
   first time you logged in, you can do so later by going to your account
   settings on SonarQube: *My account* -> *Security* -> *Generate Tokens*.

3. Then connect to Gitlab.

4. Go to the continuous integration (CI) configuration page of your fork
   (*Settings* -> *CI/CD* -> *Variables* -> *Expand*) and declare a variable
   named `SONAR_TOKEN`.  
   The value of this variable must be the value of the
   token provided by SonarQube. Check the *Mask variable* option and click on
   *Add variable*.

5. Also declare a variable `SONAR_HOST_URL` with value https://sonar.orekit.org.  
   This will allow Gitlab to connect to Orekit SonarQube instance.

6. SonarQube dynamically initiates the project on the first submission, but
   this first submission must be on the **master** branch. You can cause this
   by manually triggering a pipeline. Starting with Orekit version 11, you
   just need to go to the pipelines page (*Project homepage* -> *CI/CD* ->
   *Pipelines*), then click on *Run pipeline*, then select the **master**
   branch, then click on the *Run pipeline* button. Then wait for half an
   hour, which is approximately the time needed to compile and run the tests.

7. After that, you can run again the pipeline on your working branch.

If your working branch is from an Orekit version prior to 11.0, step 5
described above will not work because of the continuous integration scripts
did not manage forks properly. In this case, you will need to initiate the
project in SonarQube from your workstation, by executing the following
commands:

```bash
$ cd orekit-repository
$ git switch master

$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64

$ mvn -s .CI/maven-settings.xml --batch-mode --errors --fail-at-end \
      --show-version -DinstallAtEnd=true -DdeployAtEnd=true verify site

$ export SONAR_TOKEN=<your-sonarqube-token>
$ export CI_PROJECT_TITLE=Orekit
$ export CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE=<your-namespace>
$ export CI_PROJECT_NAME=orekit
$ export SONAR_PROJECT_KEY="${CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE}:${CI_PROJECT_NAME}"
$ export SONAR_PROJECT_NAME="${CI_PROJECT_TITLE} (${CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE}:${CI_PROJECT_NAME})"

$ mvn -s .CI/maven-settings.xml --batch-mode --errors --fail-at-end \
      --show-version -DinstallAtEnd=true -DdeployAtEnd=true sonar:sonar \
      -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN -Dsonar.projectKey="$SONAR_PROJECT_KEY" \
      -Dsonar.projectName="$SONAR_PROJECT_NAME"
```
