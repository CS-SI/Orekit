# Getting the sources

## Released versions

In order to get the source for officially released versions, go to the
[Files](https://www.orekit.org/forge/projects/orekit/files) tab in Orekit
forge and select one of the orekit-x.y-src.zip files. The x.y part in the name
 specifies the version. If this is the first time you download the library and
 you have not yet set up your own data set with UTC-TAI history, JPL ephemerides,
 IERS Earth Orientation Parameters ... you may want to also download the
 orekit-data.zip file which is an example file suitable for a quick start (see
 [configuration](./configuration.html) for further reading about data configuration).
