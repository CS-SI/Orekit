## Building FieldOrbit from Orbit

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, two independent ways to convert an `Orbit` into a `FieldOrbit`
were set up. One was to use a new utility class `Fieldifier` and the second one
was to use a `convertToFieldOrbit` method from `OrbitType`. As this was redundant,
the utility method in `Fieldifier` was deprecated and the `convertToFieldOrbit`
method from `OrbitType` was kept. The deprecated method was removed in 13.0

### how to adapt existing source code
If users called the utility method in `Fieldifier`, they should now call the
method from `OrbitType`. This means replacing (taking a circular orbit as an
example):

```java
import org.orekit.orbits.FieldCircularOrbit;
import org.orekit.utils.Fieldifier;

final FieldCircularOrbit<T> fieldCircularOrbit = (FieldCircularOrbit<T>) Fieldifier.fieldify(field, circularOrbit);
```
by
```java
final FieldCircularOrbit<T> fieldCircularOrbit = (FieldCircularOrbit<T>) circularOrbit.getType().convertToFieldOrbit(field);
```

## Spacecraft state interpolator requires specifying interpolation method

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, it was possible to build a `SpacecraftStateInterpolator` without
specifying the number of interpolation points or the threshold. In this case, it
used the default values. This could generate exceptions if the associated interpolators
for orbit, mass, attitude… did not use the same default values. The constructor was
deprecated in 12.0 and a new constructor added with settings for number of interpolation
points and threshold. The deprecated constructor was removed in 13.0

### how to adapt existing source code
If user code called the `SpacecraftStateInterpolator` without specifying the number of
interpolation points or the threshold, it should now add these parameters explicitly,
using `AbstractTimeInterpolator.DEFAULT_INTERPOLATION_POINTS` and
`AbstractTimeInterpolator.DEFAULT_EXTRAPOLATION_THRESHOLD_SEC`.

## Renaming in {Field}Propagator

### overview of the change
Propagators had a method `getEventsDetectors`, whose naming was inconsistent with similar functions in `EventDetectorProvider` and Hipparchus.

### how to adapt existing source code
Simply replace your calls by `getEventDetectors`.


## Building an AbsoluteDate from Instant is always in UTC time scale

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, it was possible to build an `AbsoluteDate` from a
`java.time.Instant`, specifying an arbitrary time scale. This was not
compliant with the `Instant` API which requires using UTC. A constructor
using only the `Instant` was added in 12.1 as well as a constructor with
at time scale that is enforced to be UTC. The constructor with
`Instant` and `TimeScale` was deprecated. The deprecated constructor
was removed in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code

If the constructor with a `Instant` and `TimeScale` was used and the
time scale was already UTC, then there is nothing to do. If the time
scale was not UTC, then the semantics must be revised by users, as they
did violate `Instant` API, so they probably need to check how the
`Instant` is produced, to ensure it is really in UTC.

## Position angles conversions moved

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, position angles in orbits (anomalies for `{Field}KeplerianOrbit`,
latitude arguments for `{Field}CircularOrbit`, longitude arguments for
`{Field}EquinoctialOrbit`) could be converted between their `MEAN`, `TRUE` and
`ECCENTRIC` flavors using static methods in the orbit classes themselves. These static
have been moved to dedicated utility classes `{Field}KeplerianAnomalyUtility`,
`{Field}CircularAnomalyUtility`, and `{Field}EquinoctialAnomalyUtility` as of version
12.1. The methods in the orbit classes have been deprecated in 12.1 and removed
in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code

As the methods are static ones, just the name of the class providing the
methods should be changed. This means replacing (taking circular orbit
and conversion from `ECCENTRIC` to `TRUE` as an example):
```java
final double alphaV = CircularOrbit.eccentricToTrue(ex, ey, alphaE);
```
by
```java
final double alphaV = CircularLatitudeArgumentUtility.eccentricToTrue(ex, ey, alphaE);
```

## Fitting of Earth Orientation Parameters

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, Fitting of Earth Orientation Parameters was introduced.
This was initially configured using a fitting duration as well as an exponential
weight with a time constant, starting with small weights at the beginning of the
fitting duration and increasing weights afterwards. However, this led to numerical
errors in some configurations. A new configuration was then used, starting from
the last known EOP and decreasing weights when going towards past. The fitting
duration was therefore ignored as the exponential decrease made it useless. The
corresponding constructor was deprecated. This deprecated constructor was removed
in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code
If users called the `SingleParameterFitter` with a fitting duration, they should
just remove this parameter; anyway it was ignored since 12.0.1, so this should
not have any influence.

## Tropospheric models revamped

### overview of the change

In the 12.X series, tropospheric models implemented the `DiscreteTroposphericModel`
interface. This interface used constant temperature pressure and hygrometry but
variable location, which was inconsistent. It did not allow to use models that
are azimuth-dependant (slanted atmosphere layers). It also used inconsistent non-SI
units. The interface was completely rewritten as `TroposphericModel` in 12.1, and
the existing models were rewritten to implement the new interfaces. A new `GroundStation`
constructor was added that references a `PressureTemperatureHumidityProvider` that
will be used to provide weather parameters to measurements performed by the station.
The older tropospheric model interface, the former models implementations and the
`GroundStation` constructor without provider were deprecated. In version 13.0,
the deprecated interface, implementations and constructor were all removed.

### how to adapt existing source code

All the tropospheric models available in Orekit 12.X are still available, sometimes
with different names (for example `MariniMurrayModel` is now called `MariniMurray`,
`SaastamoinenModel` is now `ModifiedSaastamoinenModel`, but there is also a
`CanonicalSaastamoinenModel`) and different constructors. Some models allow passing
a `PressureTemperatureHumidityProvider` to the constructor, which allows to retrieve
time and location-dependent weather parameters. Several new tropospheric models
have been added in the process. `AngularTroposphericDelayModifier` was also discovered
to be seriously flawed and has been replaced by `AngularRadioRefractionModifier`.

Users should review the models they use and adapt the class names as well as the
new constructor parameters. If they used a simple configuration with fixed weather
parameters, they can use either `ConstantPressureTemperatureHumidityProvider` or
`TroposphericModelUtils.STANDARD_ATMOSPHERE_PROVIDER` (or
`TroposphericModelUtils.STANDARD_ATMOSPHERE` if they need the constant values
and not the provider). For better representativity, it is suggested to use either
a global model like `GlobalPressureTemperature3` or to implement
`PressureTemperatureHumidityProvider` with a custom class downloading real
measured data.

## Empty cache without field argument

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, the `ImmutableFieldTimeStampedCache.emptyCache` had a
field argument which was in fact ignored. This method has been deprecated
in 12.1 and a new method without any argument added. The deprecated method
was removed in 13.0

### how to adapt existing source code
If users called `ImmutableFieldTimeStampedCache.emptyCache` with a field
argument, they should just remove the argument at the call site.

## Signal time of flight needs a frame

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, the `AbstractMeasurement` method `signalTimeOfFlight` only
used a `TimeStampedPVCoordinates` without care about the frame it refered too. An
additional signature was added, using a `PVCoordinatesProvider`, which required
specifying the frame. For consistency, the frame was also added in the
`TimeStampedPVCoordinates` version and the method without the frame was deprecated.
The deprecated method was removed in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code
If user code called `signalTimeOfFlight` without a frame, it should now also
pass the frame in the arguments list.

## Ambiguity handling in phase measurements

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, the phase measurements (both ground measurements and inter-satellite
measurements) managed one ambiguity parameter for each measurement, and in addition there
were dedicated modifiers for the same purpose. This was cumbersome and wasted a lot of
resources since numerous parameter drivers where create and should be managed together
as they share the same name. An `AmbiguityCache` has been set up to drastically reduce
the number of parameter drivers (allowing to use only one driver for each
emitter/receiver/wavelength triplet) and could be passed to the measurements constructors.
This cache holds `AmbiguityDriver` entries that are specialized `ParameterDriver`.
The constructor without the ambiguity cache were deprecated and a temporary default cache
was made available and used by these deprecated constructors. As with this change the
phase measurements managed the ambiguity by themselves, the additional modifiers were
also deprecated. All deprecated constructors and classes were removed in 13.0, as well
as the temporary default cache.

### how to adapt existing source code
In order to build phase measurements, users should set up one instance of an ambiguity
cache on their own (just calling `new AmbiguityCache()`) and pass it as an argument
to the phase measurements constructors (or the phase measurements builders constructors
in the measurement generation use case). The cache will be populated automatically as
measurements are created. The ambiguities can be retrieved either from the measurements
themselves (using the `getAmbiguityDriver` method) or from the cache, given the emitter,
receiver and wavelength.

## Clock offset applied flag in Rinex files

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, the `RCV CLOCK OFFS APPL` flag in Rinex observation files was
parsed as an integer, despite it really has the semantic of a flag. This was confusing
as a numerical value could lead people to think it was really the offset itself that
was stored there, when in fact the offset is present in the observations. The
integer-based getter and setters were deprecated in 12.1 and new boolean-based getters
and setters were added. The deprecated getters and setters were removed in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code
If users called `setClkOffset` or `getClkOffset`, they should replace these calls
by the boolean versions `setClockOffsetApplied` and `getClockOffsetApplied`.

## Measurement generation now returns EstimatedMeasurementBase

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, the `build` method in `MeasurementBuilder<T>` interface from
package `org.orekit.estimation.measurements.generation` did return an
object of type `T`, where `T` was the parameterized type in `MeasurementBuilder<T>`
and extended `ObservedMeasurement<T>`.

Returning only the observed value was limiting as users may sometimes need
access to the complete states that were used during the generation. These states
were in fact computed internally and discarded after the observed measurement
was produced. The rationale of this change was to allow retrieving these
complete states.

Starting with version 13.0 the return type of the `build` method was therefore
changed to `EstimatedMeasurementBase<T>`.

### how to adapt existing source code

If the additional information is relevant to the caller application, then users
should change the type of the variable they use to store the estimated measurement
and use it. This means replacing
```java
final T built = builder.build(date, interpolators);
```
by
```java
final EstimatedMeasurementBase<T> built = builder.build(date, interpolators);
```

If the additional information is not relevant to the caller application, then users
can just extract the observed measurement from the estimated measurement.
This means replacing
```java
final T built = builder.build(date, interpolators);
```
by
```java
final T built = builder.build(date, interpolators).getObservedMeasurement();
```

## getPropagators replaced by getPropagatorsMap

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, `AggregateBoundedPropagator.getPropagators` method rebuilt
the map each time it was called. It was deplrecated and replaced by a
`getPropagatorsMap` method that retruend the same map each call. The deprecated
method was removed in 13.0

### how to adapt existing source code
User code should just adapt the method name at call site.

## Removal of PropagatorBuilder copy method

### overview of the change
In 12.X series, the `PropagatorBuilder.copy()` method was deprecated and replaced
by the `.clone()` method available natively in Java. The deprecated method was removed in 13.0

### how to adapt existing source code
The change is straightforward. Users only have to replace

```java
import org.orekit.propagation.conversion.AbstractPropagatorBuilder;

final AbstractPropagatorBuilder newBuilder = builder.copy();
```
by
```java
final AbstractPropagatorBuilder newBuilder = builder.clone();
```

## New argument in {Field}AdaptableInterval's method

### overview of the change
The method `currentInterval` in `(Field)AdaptableInterval` now has a second argument called `isForward` to indicate the direction of propagation.
This allows to tailor the computation knowing this information and follows a similar change in Hipparchus.

### how to adapt existing source code
If you only use "constant" intervals, you should use the static method `of` to create instance and nothing needs changed. Otherwise, just add the second argument in your signature and use if if applicable.

## Improved robustness of spherical regions computation

### overview of the change
Computation of spherical regions is based on Binary Space Partitioning trees (`BSPTree`), which are provided
by the underlying Hipparchus library.
In some cases, when operating on regions that have almost aligned features (like a sensor swath projected
on ground, with sampled boundary points along a very regulat orbit), some numerical errors occur. A lot
of efforts have been put in improving robustness. As part of these efforts, the API in the `partitioning`
package from Hipparchus has been changed. Many classes like `BSPTree`, `BSPTreeVisitor`, `Hyperplane`,
`SubHyperplane`, `Region`, `Regionfactory`… thare were previously parameterized with the space type
(`Euclidean3D`, `Euclidean2D`, `Euclidean1D`, `Sphere2D`, `Sphere1D`) are now parameterized with both the
space type and the associated point type (`Vector3D`, `Vector2D`, `Vector1D`, `S2Point`, `S1Point`).

This Hipparchus API change does not affect the Orekit API at all (the changes are implementation details
at Orekit level), but they may affect users who build `SphericalPolygonsSet` objects using `Region` and
`RegionFactory`, which are Hipparchus classes.

### how to adapt existing source code
The required changes at users level are limited to variables declarations. They should replace `Region<Sphere2D>`
by `Region<Sphere2D, S2Point>` and `RegionFactory<Sphere2D>` by `RegionFactory<Sphere2D, S2Point>`

## Frame guessing in IGS products

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, frames guessing in IGS products like SP3 or Rinex files
was flawed. It missed several cases and returned a default Earth frame that
could be wrong. A more general utility method `IGSUtils.guessFrame` was introduced.
This method complies with more classical denominations used by IGS laboratories
and also allows as an extension to use a few non-rotating frames as used in some
industrial teams. The `SP3Parser.guessFrame` method and `SP3Parser.SP3_FRAME_CENTER_STRING`
constant were deprecated. The deprecated items were removed in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code
If user codes did call `SP3Parser.guessFrame`, they should call instead `IGSUtils.guessFrame`.

## Frequency replaced by RadioWave, GnssSignal, or PredefinedGnssSignal where relevant

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, numerous classes and methods in the library used the
enumerates `Frequency` and `ObservationType` from package `org.orekit.gnss`
directly. These enumerates listed the predefined frequencies and observable
that are used by the existing GNSS systems (GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou,
QZSS, IRNSS, SBAS).

Enumerates are fine when dealing with existing systems supported by Orekit,
but they are not sufficient when designing new navigation systems using new
frequencies or new observables. The rationale of this change was to allow using
custom frequencies and observation types. The naming convention for the first
enumerate was also awkward as the name `Frequency` was too generic and therefore
confusing and as the API also  provided access to other elements (like wavelength,
common frequency multiplier, and name). A last problem with the enumerates API was
that it used non-SI units (MHz instead of Hz for frequency).

This change was introduced in two steps, one that did not break the API
and was introduced in version 12.1 and one that did break the API and was
introduced in version 13.0.

Starting with version 12.1, several methods of this enumerate where moved
upward in new interface `GnssSignal` and its superinterface `RadioWave`.
This had no consequence on users source code. Starting with version 13.0,
the `Frequency` enumerate was renamed `PredefinedGnssSignal` and numerous
methods that did reference it were changed to reference either `RadioWave`,
`GnssSignal`, or `PredefinedGnssSignal`. The `ObservationType` was also
changed to be an interface and a new enumerate `PredefinedObservationType`
was introduced.

As long as only enumerates were used, relying on the equality operator `==`
to compare a predefined signal with a reference was relevant. It is not relevant
anymore when using interfaces implemented by custom user classes. Two
predicate methods, `closeTo(other)` and `closeTo(other, tolerance)` have
therefore been added to the new `RadioWave` interface to check if frequencies
are close enough. The first  method uses a default tolerance of 1 mHz, which is
good enough for most purposes.

A few method names have been changed according to their return types,
for example `getFrequencies()` in `Antenna` has been renamed `getRadioWaves()`,
`getFrequency()` in `ObservationType` has been renamed `getSignal()`,
and `getSignal()` in `BeidouCivilianNavigationMessage` has been renamed
`getRadioWave()`.

The Rinex parser and writer API have been extended to allow these new signals
and observation types to be used in Rinex files. Note however that as these
elements are non-standard, the files produced may be impossible to read with
applications that do not rely on Orekit for parsing.

### how to adapt existing source code

In most cases, as the interfaces are just higher level abstractions of the
same concept that was already implemented by the `Frequency` enumerate,
users can just change the types of the objects they use to either
`PredefinedGnssSignal`, `GnssSignal` or `RadioWave` depending on the method.
Sometimes the type appears in a parameterized type, so for example the
`ReceiverAntenna` constructor now requires a `Map<RadioWave, FrequencyPattern>`
instead of a `Map<Frequency, FrequencyPattern>`. Such types changes in methods
signatures and field types are sufficient if the only methods used in the
enumerate were `getName()` or `getRatio()` (which are defined in `GnssSignal`)
or if they were `getFrequency()` or `getWavelength()` (which are defined in
`RadioWave`). Note that `getMHzFrequency()` has been replaced by `getFrequency()`
which returns a predefinedGnssSignal in Hz and not in MHz anymore, for consistency with
Orekit convention to use SI units everywhere.

As explained above, if the enumerate was used directly with an equality
operator to check against some predefined value, this check should be
changed to a proximity check by calling one of the `closeTo` methods.

The call sites for methods that have changed names must be adapted to use
the new names.

## Typo in PressureTemperatureHumidityProvider API

### overview of the change
The `PressureTemperatureHumidityProvider` interface introduced in 12.0
defines two methods with name `getWeatherParamerers`, which was a typo.
The error was fixed and the name was changed to `getWeatherParameters` in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code
The change is straightforward. Users only have to replace calls to `getWeatherParamerers`
by calls to `getWeatherParameters`.

## Revamp of dates handling

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, dates were implemented using an epoch as a whole number of seconds from
a reference date and a double offset corresponding to the fractional parts of the seconds.
As the fractional part was between 0.0 and 1.0, its resolution was of the order of magnitude
of a femtosecond near 1.0, and when dates resulted from successive computations (typically
sequences of calls to `shiftedBy`), accuracies at picoseconds level could be regularly
achieved. There were however rounding problems when dates were output in textual form depending
on the number of decimal digits used. When using a number of digits ensuring safe
write/read roundtrip operations (like using the Ryū algorithm), this induced writing many digits
thar were not human-friendly. When on the other hand the number of digits was chosen to be
either human-friendly (say milliseconds or microseconds) or compliant with some standard format,
then safe write/read roundtrip operation was not possible anymore and errors crept in, typically
in ephemeris data. Another type of problems occurred when standard java `Instant`, `Date` or
`TimeUnit` were used as  they refer to milliseconds, microseconds or nanoseconds which are
decimal-based sub-multiples of the second and not binary-based sub-multiples of primitive double
numbers. A similar problem linked to decimal versus binary representation occurred when TT
(Terrestrial Time) scale was used. The offset between TT and TAI (International Atomic Time) is
by convention exactly 32.184s, and neither 32.184 nor 0.184 can be represented exactly as IEEE754
primitive double numbers. The closest normal numbers that can be represented exactly are
respectively $\frac{0x10178D4FDF3B64}{2^{47}}$ which is about 2.5 femtoseconds smaller than 32.184s,
and $\frac{0x178D4FDF3B645A}{2^{55}}$, which is about 3.11 attoseconds smaller than 0.184s.

There were also several problems with the linear models between UTC and TAI that were used before
year 1972. The offsets were whole numbers of microseconds and slopes were whole numbers of
nanoseconds per seconds. Supporting properly the linear models before 1972 may seem moot but is in
fact really required because many systems use Unix time, so it is widely used in interfaces or
databases. The official Unix time as defined by POSIX explicitly *ignores* leap seconds, but many
users ignore this specificity and would just use `new ApsoluteDate(1970, 1, 1, utc)`, expecting this
to be seamlessly interoperable with standard java `Instant`, `Date` or `TimeUnit`. It is not fully
possible but at least roundtrip conversions between the two representations, with and without leap
seconds, should remain safe. Unfortunately the 1970-01-01 epoch is located within a four years time
range (from 1968 to 1972) during which the offset between UTC and TAI exhibited a 30 ns/s slope. This
induced a 378691200 ns offset as of 1970-01-01 (to be added to the 4213170 µs offset that was active
since 1968-01-01) and the slope continued to be applied for two years later. This complicates safe
roundtrip conversions.

In order to alleviate these problems, dates handling has been thoroughly revamped. The whole number
of seconds since reference epoch is still stored as a signed primitive long like it was before, so the
range of dates that can be represented is still ±292 billions years for `AbsoluteDate` (but it is still
±5.88 millions years for `DateComponents` and `DateTimeComponents` as they use primitive int for the
day offset with respect to J2000.0). The fractional part within the second is what was changed: it is
now also stored as a non-negative primitive long with fixed precision at a resolution of one attosecond
($10^{-18}s$). The choice of attoseconds allows to represent exactly all important offsets (between TT
and TAI, or between UTC and TAI during the linear eras), as well as all times converted from standard
java `Instant`, `Date` or `TimeUnit` classes, and as it is a decimal-based sub-multiple, it is both
human-friendly, standard formats friendly and often avoids the awkward display of series of 999999
decimals that resulted from binary to decimal conversions. This choice also allows simple computation
as adding or subtracting two values in attoseconds that are both smaller than one second never overflows
(a primitive long containing a number of attoseconds could hold any values between ±9.22s, so simple
additions and subtractions of up to 9 such numbers followed by handling a carry to bring the result back
between $0$ and $10^{18}$ and updating the associated seconds number is straightforward). The workhorse
of the new implementation is a new `TimeOffset` class that contains a time offset split into seconds and
attoseconds. This new class is therefore much more accurate than the previous one (attoseconds rather
than femtoseconds) and more importantly is more robust, much simpler as it does not have to deal with IEEE-754
and finally it is decimal-friendly. Provisions have been made to properly handle `NaN`, and ±∞ (both in
computation, parsing and writing).

Many methods that used primitive double to represent durations or offsets have been rewritten to take
`TimeOffset` instances as arguments or to generate them as return values. This affects the API of classes
`AbsoluteDate`, `TimeComponents`, `DateTimeComponents`, `GNSSDate`, `OffsetModel` `UTCTAIOffset` and their
field counterparts for the classes that have one, as well as the `TimeScale` and `TimeShiftable` interfaces
and all their implementations. In most cases, the methods taking a primitive double as an argument have
been kept, and they delegate to a new method that creates a `TimeOffset` instance on the fly from the double.
Methods that returned a primitive double have sometimes been kept (for example `durationFrom` in `AbsoluteDate`
is still there) but a sister method has been created to take advantage of the new implementation with increased
accuracy (so there are now `accurateDurationFrom` and `accurateOffsetFrom` methods in `AbsoluteDate`). Some
methods that returned a primitive double have been changed and now return `TimeOffset` instances, this is in
particular the case of all the methods in the `TimeScale` interface.

The field version of `AbsoluteDate` (`FieldAbsoluteDate`) has also been rewritten and is now entirely based
on `AbsoluteDate`: each `FieldAbsoluteDate` embeds an `AbsoluteDate` that represent the same date but without
the `Field` features. This means that the `toAbsoluteDate` methods is now a simple getter and returns an already
present instance, it is much less costly than before. This improved the consistency between the non-field and
the field versions, reduced duplications a lot and greatly simplified the code.

As these changes were made, it appeared the `AggregatedPVCoordinatesProvider` class threw
`OrekitIllegalArgumentException` and `IllegalStateException` instead of `OrekitException` when
an out-of-range date was used, which make them more difficult to catch. This has been changed too.

### how to adapt existing source code
Despite the change is a revamp of the most widely used class in Orekit (`AbsoluteDate`), many
efforts have been put to preserve the public API as much as possible. Many methods using
primitive double or providing primitive double are still there. One big exception to this
is the `TimeScale` interface, which now only uses `TimeOffset` instances. As most users just
use the time scales as opaque objects when reading/writing dates, they should not be affected
too much. In any case, they can still continue using primitive double by wrapping them in or
out of `TimeOffset` instances, replacing calls like `timeScale.offsetFromTAI(date)` by
`timeScale.offsetFromTAI(date).toDouble()`. On the other hand, if they need to call a method
that needs a `TimeOffset` and they only have a primitive double, wrapping is done by replacing
calls like `object.someMethod(offset)` by `object.someMethod(new TimeOffset(offset))`.

Custom implementations of `TimeShiftable` could be updated to take advantage of the new
`shiftedBy(TimeOffset)` method, but it is not required as there is a default implementation that
delegates to the original `shiftedBy(double)` method.

If some user code breaks due to API changes, though, it is recommended to avoid using the
wrapping between primitive double and `TimeOffset`. What is recommended is to take the
opportunity to remove entirely the primitive double and generalize use of `TimeOffset`
everywhere. This will increase both accuracy of computation and robustness.

Avoiding primitive double also applies to parsing and to literal constants in models or
non-regression test input data. When parsing a text like "3.2184e+01" from a `String field`
variable, instead of using `new TimeOffset(Double.parseDouble(field))` one should rather
use `TimeOffset.parse(field)`. The rationale is that `TimeOffset.parse` preserves decimals
because it will parse the "3" and "2184" parts separately, apply the exponent and split
that into an exact 32 seconds part and an exact 184 milliseconds part, whereas the double
parsing would be slightly off (about 2.5 femtoseconds in this case) as IEEE754 cannot
represent this number exactly. The small parsing error will show up when printing dates in
some times scales. `TimeOffset.parse(field)` also supports parsing special offsets
like `NaN` (regardless of case), `-∞` and `+∞` (for parsing infinity, the sign is mandatory).
When using literal constants in source code (say for example 32.184 as
before, which is the offset between TT and TAI) then rather than using `new TimeOffset(32.184)`,
users should use the linear combinations constructors as in
`new TimeOffset(32, TimeOffset.SECOND, 184, TimeOffset.MILLISECOND)`. There are such linear
combinations constructors from 1 to 5 terms and the multiplicative factors can be long integers.

The static method `TimeComponents.fromSecond` intended to finely tune construction of dates
within a leap second occurrence has been replaced by a public constructor taking a single
`TimeOffset` argument instead of its first two arguments.

In the `OffsetModel` class, the units for slopes in UTC-TAI linear models used prior to 1972
were changed from seconds per day to nanoseconds per UTC second (despite neither is a SI unit),
as looking at the values shows these slopes were in fact simple numbers (only three different
slopes were used between 1961 and 1972: 15ns/s, 13ns/s and 30ns/s). The offset has also been
changed from double to `TimeOffset` to allow representing exactly the microseconds offsets used
in linear models before 1972. As the `UTCTAIOffset` and `OffsetModel` classes are mainly
intended to implement UTC-TAI loaders and Orekit already provides loaders for the major formats,
this should not affect many users. For those users who did implement custom loaders that take
old slopes and double offsets into account, they should scale the slopes by changing their
parsing code from `double slope = Double.parseDouble(field)` to
`int slope = (int) (TimeOffset.parse(field).getAttoSeconds() / SLOPE_FACTOR)` were `SLOPE_FACTOR`
is defined as `long SLOPE_FACTOR = 86400L * 1000000000L`; and then build the offset by using
this integer slope in nanoseconds per UTC seconds. Using `TimeOffset.parse` instead of
`Double.parseDouble` avoids numerical noise as parsing is done in decimal.

If users caught `OrekitIllegalArgumentException` and `IllegalStateException` when using
`AggregatedPVCoordinatesProvider`, they must now catch `OrekitException` to recover from out-of-range
dates.

As dates resolution is now always exactly one attosecond, when using `shitftedBy` to set up a date just
before of after another date (for example to set up a transition in a `TimeSpanMap`), the recommended
shift value is either `TimeOffset.ATTOSECOND` or `TimeOffset.ATTOSECOND.negate()`. Using `Double.MIN_VALUE`
won't work (anyway, it only worked in previous versions when the date was exactly at a TAI second, i.e.
when the offset was exactly 0.0).

A new `createMedian` factory method has also been added to `{Field}AbsoluteDate`

## Signal time of flight endpoints adjustment

### overview of the change
In 12.X series, the `signalTimeOfFlight` method assumed the signal was received at
a known fixed date, but was emitted at an earlier unknown date that is estimated.
In some cases (typically in GNSS where signals are generated by atomic clocks),
it is the emission date that is perfectly known and it is the later arrival time
that should be estimated.

The `signalTimeOfFlight` method was therefore renamed `signalTimeOfFlightAdjustableEmitter`
and new `signalTimeOfFlightAdjustableReceiver` methods with various signatures
were added in 13.0.

### how to adapt existing source code
The change is straightforward. Users only have to replace calls to `signalTimeOfFlight`
by calls to `signalTimeOfFlightAdjustableEmitter`.

## Revamped Sinex and Sinex bias parsing

### overview of the change
In 12.X series, Sinex and Sinex-bias files parsing was not in line with other formats parsers
implementations. It still refers to `DataLoader` instead of the new `DataSource` paradigm,
hence relying on a regular expression for supported names and Sinex files being contained
in a `DataContext`. The `SinexLoader` class was a huge and complicated class and was a nightmare
to maintain. It was used both as the parser and as the container for parsed results. It mixed
Sinex and Sinex bias, which despite having a common base are different formats. It did not allow
proper loading of Observable-Specific Signal Biases, it only handled Differential Signal Biases
and probably mixed things up when parsing OSB or IFB files. It also used the older naming convention
of Differential Code Bias despite newer biases can refer to phase and not to code only, so they
are now named Differential Signal Bias. During parsing, it merged the description within the data
despite they are separated in the files. It only used string fields even for parts that had proper
associated classes, like satellite in system or observable types. The loaded biases were claimed
to be in SI units, but in fact phase biases could not really be parsed because the cycles unit
was not aavailable and the code biases despite being in one SI units (converted from nanoseconds
to seconds), this was not really consistent with a pseudo-range measurement in meters.

The Sinex parse also did not load complete phase center positions, it parsed SITE/ECCENTRICITY but
this represents only a global Antenna Reference Point (ARP). The real phase centers are offset with
respect to the ARP and are frequency dependent. For ground receivers, the phase centers are provided
in the SITE/GPS_PHASE_CENTER and SITE/GAL_PHASE_CENTER blocks. For satellites, there is a
SATELLITE/PHASE_CENTER block. All these blocks were ignored.

In order to alleviate all these shortcomings, parsing was rewritten from the ground up and split into
several specialized block and line parsers as well as several containers. Support for Observable-Specific
Signal Biases was added (but support for Ionosphere-Free Signal Bias, IFB, is still lacking, it could
however be added easily if required, thanks to the new modular architecture). A new unit, `Unit.CYCLE`
with name "cyc" was added, it is a dimensionless unit (just like the already existing `Unit.NONE`,
`Unit.ONE`, and `Unit.PERCENT`).

### how to adapt existing source code
Users that relied on `SinexLoader` class configured from a regular expression for supported names
and requiring the Sinex files to be available in a data context should now use either the `SinexParser`
or the `SinexBiasParser` class and pass to their `parse` methods the `DataSource` instances they want to
parse. This is simpler and more consistent with other existing parsers in Orekit (CCSDS, Rinex, SP3, CRD,
CPF, GPT…). The `parse` methods return a container holding the parsed data, `Sinex` in the `SinexParser`
case and `SinexBias` in the `SinexBiasParser` case.

When using `SinexParser` to load Earth Orientation Parameters, users should be aware that since Sinex
files contain only one EOP entry block, they should call the `parse` method with several `DataSource`
instances to have a reasonable time range covered. This was already the case in the previous implementation
and was generally worked around using a regular expression that matched several Sinex files. The resulting
`Sinex` container does not implement`EopHistoryLoader` by itself, instead it has a `getEopLoader` that
returns such an object. The `ITRFVersion` that should be used to build the EOP history is now specified
when calling `getEopLoader` after parsing and not before parsing as was needed before.

The getters for accessing parsed data have been streamlined. The different levels of maps in `SinexBias`
have been renamed according to the new naming conventions to use `Dsc` instead of `Dcb`. The satellites
keys have been changed from `String` to `SatInSystem` with a specific Pseudo-Random-Number
`SatInSystem.ANY_PRN` (which is set to -1) used to represent system-wide biases. The observations keys
have been changed from `String` to `ObservationType`. The `SinexParser` takes a `typeBuilder` argument
allowing users to parse custom `ObservationType` if needed. This `typeBuilder` can safely be set to
`PredefinedObservationType::valueOf` when parsing Sinex-bias files containing only predefined observation
types.

The code biases are now in meters SI unit, the `Constants.SPEED_OF_LIGHT` conversion factor is already
applied by the parser itself. Users should not apply this factor anymore at their level.

The `getAntennaType` getter in the `Station` objects provided by `Sinex.getStations` has been replaced by
a `getAntennaKey` method that returns a container with both the antenna type and the serial number. A new
`getPhaseCenters` method that returns a map from GNSS signals to phase centers has also been added. This
method uses the antenna keys and handles cases where for example the `SITE/GPS_PHASE_CENTER` block in the
Sinex file uses a catch-all "-----" entry that matches all serial numbers whereas the `SITE/ANTENNA` block
uses specific serial numbers for the antennas.

## Improved performance of indirect shooting

### overview of the change
The bottleneck of indirect shooting was the call to `propagate` on `FieldNumericalPropagator`,
plagued by event detection as well as adaptive step-size when used.
To improve performance, the integration is now done step by step (using the non-Field history),
by direct calls to the Hipparchus integrator (requiring to build ODE equations).
Also for this reason, the `ShootingIntegrationSettings` has been revamped, now imposing `(Field)ExplicitRungeKuttaIntegratorBuilder`.

### how to adapt existing source code
The `buildFieldPropagator` method in `AbstractIndirectShooting` does not exist anymore, but inheritors must now implement `buildFieldODE`.
The classes `ClassicalRungeKuttaIntegrationSettings` and `DormandPrince54IntegrationSettings` have been removed.
Instead, you can use the `ShootingIntegrationSettingsFactory`, which offer more built-in choices.

## Use SatInSystem in SatelliteAntenna

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, `SatelliteAntenna` used separate fields and accessors for satellite system
and satellite Pseudo-Random-Number, despite a `SatInSystem` container already existed for this.
This was both awkward and dupplicated PRN offsets logic when parsing satellites antenna from Antex
files. PRN numbers in several IGS files (Rinex, Sinex, Antex…) are shifted by a 100 units offset
for SBAS system and shifted by 192 units for QZSS systems.

The change was to generalize use of `SatInSystem` and moving the parsing logic from the various
format-specific parsers to `SatInSystem`.

### how to adapt existing source code
The `SatelliteAntenna` constructor now takes a `SatInSystem` argument instead of separate system
and prn. Users that do not build the instances themselves but simply retrieve them using
`AntexLoader` will not be affected by this change, other users should change the call to the
constructor and build a `SatInSystem` instance beforehand.

The `getSatelliteSystem` and `getPrnNumber` have been replaced by a single `getSatInSystem` method,
which in turn gives access to the system and PRN.

## Revamped {Field}ImpulseManeuver

### overview of the change
The classes `ImpulseManeuver` and `FieldImpulseManeuver` do not inherit anymore from `AbstractDetector` and
`FieldAbstractDetector` anymore. The rational is that the `create` method was unsafe, allowing users to replace the 
handler, which should not happen for the logic to work. Nonetheless, a `withDetectionSettings` method has been preserved.
On another note, the maneuver is now applied no matter the `Action` returned by the event trigger's handler, 
whilst before it was only if it was `STOP`, which was somewhat arbitrary and was preventing from using `RecordAndContinue`.

### how to adapt existing source code
Replace any calls to `create` by `withDetectionSettings` when applicable. In case your trigger had a
`StopOnIncreasing` or `StopOnDecreasing` handler, use an `EventPredicateFilter` instead.

## Removed deprecated signature of create method in {Field}AbstractDetector

### overview of the change
The `create` method of `AbstractDetector` and `FieldAbstractDetector` now has only one signature, 
involving `EventDetectionSettings` and `FieldEventDetectionSettings`. 
This way, future modifications to the detection system will not impact the signature anymore, as it should be buffered by the data container.
The old, longer signature which was already deprecated has been removed. 

### how to adapt existing source code
Implement `create` with the only possible arguments.
Note that if you do not use the `with` method, you probably do not need to use `(Field)AbstractDetector` and `(Field)EventDetector` may well be enough for your need.

## Simplify use of AttitudesSequence

### overview of the change
The interface `AttitudeProvider` now implements `EventDetectorsProvider`, with default methods returning empty `Stream`.
The rational is that internal events such as discontinuities in attitude are thus fed to propagators internally.
The class `AttitudesSequence` leverages this change, so that `registerSwitchEvents` does not exist anymore.

### how to adapt existing source code
Simply delete the calls to `registerSwitchEvents`. 
The propagator will automatically use the switches if you used `setAttitudeProvider`.

## Deprecate ExtendedPVCoordinatesProvider

### overview of the change
The class `ExtendedPVCoordinatesProvider` has been deprecated and `ExtendedPositionProvider` should be used instead.
The rationale is that the reference to PVCoordinates is confusing as implementations did not necessarily provide with accelerations.
Moreover, `ExtendedPositionProvider` only requires a `Field` implementation of `getPosition`, the other methods are deduced from it using automatic differentiation.
This way, all velocity vectors are the first time derivative of the position vectors by construction, something that was not guaranteed before.

### how to adapt existing source code
Replace any calls to `ExtendedPVCoordinatesProvider` and `ExtendedPVCoordinatesProviderAdapter` by `ExtendedPositionProvider` and `ExtendedPositionProviderAdapter` respectively.
A method `toExtendedPVCoordinatesProvider` has been added to `ExtendedPositionProvider` to facilitate phasing out.

## Rates in {Field}Orbit

### overview of the change
In the 12.X series, `Orbit` and `FieldOrbit` would respectively have Nan and null rates for orbital elements if none was passed explicitly.
Now there are default values, which are the Keplerian ones, meaning that most of them are zero (only the position angle varies).
In consequence, the method `hasDerivatives` in orbits has been renamed, as well as `removeRates` in the interface `PositionAngleBased`.


### how to adapt existing source code
Replace your calls to `hasDerivatives` by `hasNonKeplerianAcceleration`, `removeRates` by `withKeplerianRates` and `hasRates` by `hasNonKeplerianRates`.
Moreover, do not expect NaN or null rates anymore.

## Implemented createHarvester in GNSS propagator

### overview of the change
The GNSS propagators are specialized analytical propagators that fit the orbit of navigation
satellites for short duration (up to a few hours, far less than one orbit). They correspond to
the models that are broadcast in navigation signals so end users can compute their own position,
knowing the emitting satellites position.
In the 12.X series, these propagators could only be built by loading external data (Rinex
navigation files, RTCM streams…) but could not be fit by Orekit itself using orbit determination
or fitting of precise ephemerides.

The change was to replace the fixed parameters of the analytical models (initial orbital parameters,
drifts and harmonic correction coefficients) by `ParameterDriver`, introduce a trio of new classes
`GnssHarvester`, `GnssGradientConverter` and `FieldGnssPropagator` and link them to the `GNSSPropagator`
class, so it now returns an instance of `GnssHarvester` when its `setupMatricesComputation` method is
called instead of throwing an `UnsupportedOperationException` as it did previously.

In order to make this change, the `GNSSOrbitalElements` interface that is at the root of a deep
classes hierarchy containing all GNSS almanacs and navigation messages has been changed from an
interface to a class that holds the various `ParameterDriver` instances. This implies that directly
at this root level, the parameters can be changed (by calling `ParameterDriver.setValue()`). Some
cleanup have been made so the `setDate` method that was available deeper in the hierarchy has
been removed to ensure the date remains always consistent with the `getTimeDriver()` parameter when
it is updated, either by calling `setValue` at parameter driver level or by calling `setTime` directly.
The constructors then require additional parameters (`TimeScales` and `SatelliteSystem`) to properly
recompute the date on the fly.

### how to adapt existing source code
The main change for user code is that now it is possible to call `setupMatricesComputation` for
GNSS propagators (this was the goal of the change).

Side effects are that users building directly classes from the hierarchy rooted at `GNSSOrbitalElements`
now need to provide `TimeScales` and `SatelliteSystem` arguments to base class constructors for the dates
handling, and they need to remove existing calls to `setDate` (which are obsolete as date is always kept
in sync with the GNSS time parameter. If they developed their own classes, these classes should now *extend*
`GNSSOrbitalElements` instead of *implementing* it as it is now a class.

These effects should not affect many users as classes in the `GNSSOrbitalElements` hierarchy are mainly
built internally (for example by the Rinex parsers) and users generally only get the already built instances
to pass them for example to GNSS propagators. One should be aware that in some strange cases, the
`SatelliteSystem` to use at construction is not always the one corresponding to the real constellation.
This happens for example internally when we parse Rinex navigation files, as in these files the week number
for Galileo, IRNSS and QZSS must be aligned with GPS week and not the original system week (but for an unknown
reason, Rinex files specification requires to not change alignment for Beidou satellites and to keep the
Beidou constellation reference).

## Added getEffectName to EstimationModifier

### overview of the change
A `getEffectName` has been added in 13.0 to the `EstimationModifier` interface, so it is
easier to analyse the various contributors to an estimated measurement. All modifiers
provided by Orekit implement this new method and return a small effect name (troposphere,
ionosphere, wind-up…).

### how to adapt existing source code
If users implemented their own modifiers, they must implement this method, typically by just
returning a literal constant hard-coded in the implementation class or one of its super-classes.

## Moved AdaptableInterval

### overview of the change
The interfaces `AdaptableInterval` and `FieldAdaptableInterval` have been moved down to the subpackage `intervals` in `events`, 
where their native inheritors already were. This makes for a cleaner architecture.

### how to adapt existing source code
Modify the import by adding `intervals`.

## Renamed EarthITU453AtmosphereRefraction into ITURP834AtmosphericRefraction

### overview of the change
The `EarthITU453AtmosphereRefraction` used up to 12.0 was misleading as the model implemented
was really ITU-R P.834. The class has therefore with renamed with the correct ITU recommendation
number: `ITURP834AtmosphericRefraction`; new `ITURP834PathDelay`, `ITURP834MappingFunction`,
and `ITURP834WeatherParametersProvider` models have been added too, with consistent naming.

### how to adapt existing source code
Users should just change the class name they use.

## Renamed DEFAULT_MAXCHECK into DEFAULT_MAX_CHECK

### overview of the change
Different names were in use for the so-called maximum check parameter for event detection.
`DEFAULT_MAX_CHECK` has been set as the unique one, in line with `DEFAULT_MAX_ITER`.

### how to adapt existing source code
Simply replace any calls to `DEFAULT_MAXCHECK` with `DEFAULT_MAX_CHECK`.

## Updated indirect cost functions

### overview of the change
The `Field` methods in the interface `CartesianCost` have been extracted to a `FieldCartesianCost`. 
The rationale is to give more flexibility for the latter. 
As a consequence `CartesianAdjointDynamicsProvider` is now an abstract class. 
Usual inheritors are available in `CartesianAdjointDynamicsProviderFactory`.

### how to adapt existing source code
For `Field` methods of cost functions, use the new classes e.g. `FieldUnboundedEnergy`.
Use `CartesianAdjointDynamicsProviderFactory` if applicable, otherwise get inspiration from it to create your own implementation of `CartesianAdjointDynamicsProvider`.


## Extract switch handler from AttitudesSequence

### overview of the change
The interface `SwitchHandler` has been extracted from `AttitudesSequence` and renamed `AttitudeSwitchHandler` for clarity.
It is also used by the new class `AttitudesSwitcher`.

### how to adapt existing source code
Simply replace any calls to `AttitudesSequences.SwitchHandler` with `AttitudeSwitchHandler`.

## Changed attitude override in Maneuver

### overview of the change
The (possible null) attribute `attitudeOverride` in `Maneuver` is now an instance of a new interface `AttitudeRotationModel`, above`AttitudeProvider`.
It allows users to define `ParameterDriver` in order to include their derivatives in the State Transition Matrix computation with `(Field)NumericalPropagator`.

### how to adapt existing source code
You need to cast the output of `getAttitudeOverride` as `AttitudeProvider` if you intend to use its specific methods 
after passing it to the constructor of `Maneuver`.

## Introduced generic in integrator builder

### overview of the change
Java generics have been introduced in abstract classes inheriting from `(Field)ODEIntegratorBuilder`.
It removes the need for casting on outputs. As part of this change, the two interfaces now only return interfaces, 
not abstract classes.

### how to adapt existing source code
Declare outputs of `ODEIntegratorBuilder` as `ODEIntegrator` instead of `AbstractIntegrator`. 
Similarly, declare outputs of `FieldODEIntegratorBuilder` as `FieldODEIntegrator` instead of `AbstractFieldIntegrator`.

## Introduced impulse provider for maneuvers

### overview of the change
The full constructor of `(Field)ImpulseManeuver` has changed. 
Instead of providing a given `(Field)Vector3D`, users have the possibility to build a full logic via the `(Field)ImpulseProvider` interface.
This new API also allows using a single detector for maneuvers of different magnitude.
Most of the constructors signatures have been preserved, but the `getDeltaVSat` does not exist anymore.

### how to adapt existing source code
One cannot call `getDeltaVSat` anymore. If you need to know what velocity was applied, you can use
a `RecordAndContinue` event handler for instance and call the `(Field)ImpulseProvider` on the collected states.

## Added ITU NeQuick2 ionospheric model

### overview of the change
The NeQuick model from Aeronomy and Radiopropagation Laboratory of the Abdus Salam International Centre
for Theoretical Physics Trieste, Italy has been available in Orekit since version 10.1 but only as the
Galileo-specific version. This version differs from the original model recommended by ITU in a number of ways.
It uses a different modified dip latitude grid, it uses a different way to integrate electron density, it has
different clipping constraints at low altitudes…
The ITU recommended implementation has therefore been added as a new `NeQuickITU` class alongside the Galileo-pecific
one which has been renamed from `NeQuickModel` to `NeQuickGalileo`, and moved in a dedicated `nequick` package.

### how to adapt existing source code
Users that relied on the Galileo-specific model and that still want to use it just have to use the new name of the class,
`NeQuickGalileo` and import it from the `org.orekit.models.earth.ionosphere.nequick` package.

Users that want to use the ITU-recommended version should use `NeQuickITU` from the
`org.orekit.models.earth.ionosphere.nequick` package.

## Generalized ProfileThrustPropulsionModel

### overview of the change
The class `ProfileThrustPropulsionModel` was using polynomial segments for no particular reasons, 
so they have been generalized as `ThrustVectorProvider`. The mass is now an argument as well to broaden applications.

### how to adapt existing source code
The original constructor of `ProfileThrustPropulsionModel` has been replaced by an static `of` method, 
since now a `TimeSpanMap` of `ThrustVectorProvider` is expected as argument. 

## Introduce resettable maneuver trigger

### overview of the change
The interface `ManeuverTriggers` included resetters which are not used in `Maneuver`, so
a new dedicated, intermediate interface has been introduced, called `ResettableManeuverTriggers`.

### how to adapt existing source code
If you do use resetters, replace `ManeuverTriggers` by `ResettableManeuverTriggers`.
If you were not implementing these methods with actual logic, remove them. 

## Removed intelligent serialization

### overview of the change
All objects that implemented `Serializable` and that needed a dedicated so-called data transfer object to do so have had
that code removed, as well as their `serializationUID`. The motivations were numerous.
First of all, often that process was based on a default `DataContext` and the `Field` equivalent classes were usually not `Serializable`.
Moreover, it made code maintenance more tedious, especially since Orekit is still in Java 1.8 and does not have the
`Record` type which is very convenient for serialization.

### how to adapt existing source code
Stop using native serialization of `Orbit`, `PVCoordinates`, etc. 
If needed by users, they are encouraged to implement their own mechanism.


## Removed chained getters in (Field)SpacecraftState

### overview of the change
`(Field)SpacecraftState` wraps getters from the - possibly present - `(Field)Orbit` attribute. 
This is not safe as it can be `NaN` for `Orbit` and `null` for `FieldOrbit`. 
These methods e.g. `getA` have been removed.

### how to adapt existing source code
Use `getOrbit` before `getA`, etc. One can check if they are present with `isOrbitDefined`.
