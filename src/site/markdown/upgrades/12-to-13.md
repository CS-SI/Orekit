# Upgrading from Orekit 12.X to Orekit 13.0

Version 13.0 of Orekit introduced some incompatible API changes with respect
to versions 12.x. These changes are summarized in the following table. The next
paragraphs give hints about what should be changed in application source code to
adapt to this new version.

## measurement generation now returns EstimatedMeasurementBase

### overview of the change
Up to version 12.X, the `build` method in `MeasurementBuilder<T>` interface from
package `org.orekit.estimation.measurements.generation` did return an
object of type `T`, where `T` was the parameterized type in `MeasurementBuilder<T>`
and extended `ObservedMeasurement<T>`.

Returning only the observed value was limiting as users may sometimes need
access to the complete states that were used during the generation. These states
were in fact computed internally and discarded after the observed measurement
was produced. The rationale of this change was to allow retrieving these
complete states.

Starting with version 13.0 the return type of the `build` method was therefore
changed to `EstimatedMeasurementBase<T>`.

### how to adapt existing source code

If the additional information is relevant to the caller application, then users
should change the type of the variable they use to store the estimated measurement
and use it. This means replacing
```java
final T built = builder.build(date, interpolators);
```
by
```java
final EstimatedMeasurementBase<T> built = builder.build(date, interpolators);
```

If the additional information is not relevant to the caller application, then users
can just extract the observed measurement from the estimated measurement.
This means replacing
```java
final T built = builder.build(date, interpolators);
```
by
```java
final T built = builder.build(date, interpolators).getObservedMeasurement();
```

## Frequency replaced by RadioWave or GnssSignal where relevant

### overview of the change
Up to version 12.X, numerous classes and methods in the library used the
enumerate `Frequency` from package `org.orekit.gnss` directly. This enumerate
lists the predefined frequencies that are used by the existing GNSS systems
(GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou, QZSS, IRNSS, SBAS).

An enumerate is fine when dealing with existing systems supported by Orekit,
but it is not sufficient when designing new navigation systems using new
frequencies or new names. The rationale of this change was to allow using
custom frequencies.

This change was introduced in two steps, one that did not break the API
and was introduced in version 12.1 and one that did break the API and was
introduced in version 13.0.

Starting with version 12.1, several methods of this enumerate where moved
upward in new interface `GnssSignal` and its superinterface `RadioWave`.
This had no consequence on users source code. Starting with version 13.0,
numerous method that did reference the `Frequency` enumerate were changed
to reference either `GnssSignal` or `RadioWave`.

As long as only an enumerate was used, relying on the equality operator `==`
to compare a frequency with a reference was relevant. It is not relevant
anymore when using interfaces implemented by custom user classes. Two
predicate methods, `closeTo(other)` and `closeTo(other, tolerance)` have
therefore been added to check if frequencies are close enough. The first
method uses a default tolerance of 1 mHz, which is enough for most purposes.

A few method names have been changed according to their return types,
for example `getFrequencies()` in `Antenna` has been renamed `getRadioWaves()`
and `getSignal()` in `BeidouCivilianNavigationMessage` has been renamed
`getRadioWave()`.

### how to adapt existing source code

In most cases, as the interfaces are just higher level abstractions of the
same concept that was already implemented by the `Frequency` enumerate,
users can just change the types of the objects they use to either
`GnssSignal` or `RadioWave` depending on the method. Sometimes the type
appears in a parameterized type, so for example the `ReceiverAntenna`
constructor now requires a `Map<RadioWave, FrequencyPattern>` instead of
a `Map<Frequency, FrequencyPattern>`. Such types changes in methods signatures
and field types are sufficient if the only methods used in the enumerate were
`getName()` or `getRatio()` (which are defined in `GnssSignal`) or if they
were `getFrequency()` `getWavelength()` (which are defined in `RadioWave`).
Note that `getMHzFrequency()` has been replaced by `getFrequency()` which
returns a frequency in Hz and not in MHz anymore, for consistency with Orekit
convention to use SI units everywhere.

As explained above, if the enumerate was used directly with an equality
operator to check against some predefined value, this check should be
changed to a proximity check by calling one of the `closeTo` methods.

The call sites for methods that have changed names must be adapted to use
the new names.
