# Custom filters

As explained on the [filtering](./filtering.html) page, the `DataProvidersManager.applyAllFilters`
method works by looping over all registered `DataFilter` instances and calling their `filter` method
with the current `NamedData`. If the `filter` method returns the _exact same instance_ that was passed
to it, it means the filter does not do anything. In this case, the `DataProvidersManager.applyAllFilters`
method just continues its loop and check the next filter. If the `filter` method returns a different
`NamedData` instance that was passed to it, it means the filter does indeed act on the bytes stream.
In this case, the `DataProvidersManager.applyAllFilters` method sets the current `NamedData` to the
returned value and restart its loop from the beginning.

This algorithm allows the same filter to be applied several time if needed, and it also allows
the filters to be applied in any order, regardless of the order in which they have been registered
to the `DataProvidersManager`.

Users may benefit from this general feature to add their own filters. One example could be
a deciphering algorithm if sensitive data should be stored enciphered and should be deciphered
on the fly when data is loaded.

## Implementing a filter

As per the way the `applyAllFilters` method works, the `filter` method must be implemented in such
a way that it should check the `NamedData` passed to it and return its parameter if it considers
it should not filter it, or return a new `NamedData` if it considers is should filter it.

Checking is typically done using only the name and looking for files extensions, but it could as
well be made by opening temporarily the stream to read just the first few bytes to look for some
magic number and closing it afterwards, as the `NamedData` passed as a parameter has an `openStream`
method that can be called as many times as one wants.

As `applyAllFilters` restarts its loop from the beginning each time a filter is added to the stack,
some care must be taken to avoid stacking an infinite number of instances of the same filter on top
of each other. This means that the filtered `NamedData` returned after filtering should be recognized
as already filtered and not matched again by the same filter. If the check is based on file names
extensions (like `.gz` for gzip-compressed files), then if the original `NamedData` has a name of
the form `base.ext.gz` than the filtered file should have a name of the form `base.ext`. Another point
is that if a filters does not act on a `NamedData`, then it _must_ return the same instance that
was passed to it, it must _not_ simply create a transparent filter that just passes names and bytes
unchanged, otherwise it would be considered as a valid filter and added again and again until either
a stack overflow or memory exhaustion exception occurs.

The filtering part itself is implemented by opening the bytes stream from the underlying original
`NamedData`, reading raw bytes from it, performing the processing on these bytes (uncompressing,
deciphering, ...) and returning them as another stream.

The following example shows how to do that for a dummy deciphering algorithm based on a simple
XOR (this is a toy example only, not intended to be secure at all).

    public class XorFilter implements DataFilter {

        /** Suffix for XOR ciphered files. */
        private static final String SUFFIX = ".xor";

        /** Highly secret key. */
        private static final int key = 0x3b;

        /** {@inheritDoc} */
        @Override
        public NamedData filter(final NamedData original) {
            final String                 oName   = original.getName();
            final NamedData.StreamOpener oOpener = original.getStreamOpener();
            if (oName.endsWith(SUFFIX)) {
                final String                 fName   = oName.substring(0, oName.length() - SUFFIX.length());
                final NamedData.StreamOpener fOpener = () -> new XORInputStream(oName, oOpener.openStream());
                return new NamedData(fName, fOpener);
            } else {
                return original;
            }
        }

        /** Filtering of XOR ciphered stream. */
        private static class XORInputStream extends InputStream {

            /** File name. */
            private final String name;

            /** Underlying compressed stream. */
            private final InputStream input;

            /** Indicator for end of input. */
            private boolean endOfInput;
 
            /** Simple constructor.
             * @param name file name
             * @param input underlying compressed stream
             * @exception IOException if first bytes cannot be read
             */
            XORInputStream(final String name, final InputStream input)
                throws IOException {
                this.name       = name;
                this.input      = input;
                this.endOfInput = false;
            }

            /** {@inheritDoc} */
            @Override
            public int read() throws IOException {

                if (endOfInput) {
                    // we have reached end of data
                    return -1;
                }

                final int raw = input.read();
                if (raw < 0) {
                  endOfInput = true;
                  return -1;
                } else {
                  return raw ^ key;
                }

            }

        }

    }
