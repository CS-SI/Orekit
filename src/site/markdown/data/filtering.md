# Filtering

Orekit provides an automatic filtering feature for data loaded through a
`DataProvidersManager` instance. All filters implement the `DataFilter`
interface and can be registered to a `DataProvidersManager`
instance. In the default configuration, three filters are registered:

  - `GzipFilter` which uncompresses files compressed with the gzip algorithm
  - `UnixCompressFilter` which uncompresses files compressed with the Unix compress algorithm
  - `HatanakaCompressFilter` which uncompresses RINEX files compressed with the Hatanaka method

Upon load time, all filters that can be applied to a set of data will
be applied. If for example a file is both encrypted and compressed
(in any order) and filters exist for uncompression and for deciphering,
then both filters wiil be applied in the right order to the data retrieved
by the `DataProvider` before being fed to the `DataLoader`.

The following class diagrams shows the main classes and interfaces involved
in this feature.

## Filtering stack

The filtering architecture is based on a stack of `NamedData` instances, with at the bottom
an instance created by a `DataProvider` that will read bytes directly from storage, then some
instances added  by the `DataProvidersManager.applyAllFilters` method, each one reading
bytes from the underlying stack element and providing filtered bytes to the next element
upward. If at the end the name part of the `NamedData` matches the name that the
`DataLoader` instance expects, then the byte stream of the top of the stack is opened. This is
were the lazy opening occurs, and it generally ends up with all the intermediate bytes streams
being opened as well. The opened stream is then passed to the `DataLoader` to be parsed. If
on the other hand the name part of the `NamedData` does not match the name that the
`DataLoader` instance expects, then the full stack is discarded and the next resource/file
from the `DataProvider` is considered for filtering and loading.

## Example

One example will explain this method more clearly. Consider a `DirectoryCrawler`
configured to look into a directories tree containing files `tai-utc.dat` and
`MSAFE/may2019f10_prd.txt.gz`, one of the defaults filters: `GzipFilter` that uncompress files
with the `.gz` extension (the defaults filters also include `UnixCompressFilter` and
`HatanakaCompressFilter`, they are omitted for clarity), and consider
`MarshallSolarActivityFutureEstimation` which implements `DataLoader` and can
load files whose name follow a pattern mmmyyyyf10_prd.txt (among others).

![data filtering sequence diagram](../images/design/data-filtering-sequence-diagram.png)

When the `tai-utc.dat` file is considered, a `NamedData` is created for it. Then the
filters are checked (only one filter shown in the diagram), and all of them decline to act
on the file, so they all return the same `NamedData` that was created for the raw file.
At the end of the filters loop, the name (which is still `tai-utc.dat`) is checked against the
expected pattern. As it does not match, the stack composed of only one `NamedData` is discarded.
During all checks, the file as not been opened at all, only its name has been considered.

The `DirectoryCrawler` then considers the next directory, and in this directory the next
file which is `may2019f10_prd.txt.gz`. A new `NamedData` is created for it and the filters are
checked. As the extension is `.gz`, the `GzipFilter` filter considers it can act on the file
and it create and returns a new `NamedData`, with name set to `may2019f10_prd.txt` and lazy
stream opener set to insert an uncompressing algorithm between the raw file bytes
stream and the uncompressed bytes stream it will provide. The loop is restarted, but no other
filter applies so at the end the stack contains two `NamedData`, the bottom one reading from
storage and providing gzip compressed data, and the top one reading the gzip compressed data,
uncompressing it and providing uncompressed data. As the name of the top instance matches the
expected pattern for MSAFE data, the `MarshallSolarActivityFutureEstimation` will be able to
load it. At this stage, the `DirectoryCrawler` calls the method to open the bytes stream at the
top level of the stack. This method then asks the underlying `NamedData` to open its stream
(which it the raw file data), feeds the gzip uncompression algorithm with this data and provides
the output uncompressed data as a newly opened bytes stream. The data loader then parses the data,
without knowing that is is uncompressed on the fly.
