# Overview

  OREKIT is a free low-level space dynamics library written in Java.

  It provides basic elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames ...) and
  various algorithms to handle them (conversions, analytical and numerical
  propagation, pointing ...).

## Features

        * Eckstein-Heschler

    * numerical propagators
        * central attraction
        * gravity models including time-dependent like trends and pulsations
          (automatic reading of ICGEM (new Eigen models), SHM (old Eigen models),
          EGM and GRGS gravity field files formats, even compressed)
        * atmospheric drag
        * third body attraction (with data for Sun, Moon and all solar systems planets)

      model parameters for numerical, semi-analytical, and analytical propagation
      models
    * trajectories around Lagragian points using CR3BP model
    * tabulated ephemerides
        * file based
        * memory based
        * integration based
    * Taylor-algebra (or any other real field) version of most of the above propagators,
        with all force models, events detection, orbits types, coordinates types and frames
        allowing high order uncertainties and derivatives computation or very fast Monte-Carlo
        analyzes
    * unified interface above analytical/numerical/tabulated propagators for easy
      switch from coarse analysis to fine simulation with one line change
    * all propagators can manage the time loop by themselves and handle callback
      functions (called step handlers) from the calling application at each time step.
        * step handlers can be called at discrete time at regular time steps, which are
          independent of propagator time steps
        * step handlers can be called with interpolators valid throughout one propagator
          time step, which can have varying sizes
        * step handlers can be switched off completely, when only final state is desired
        * special step handlers are provided for a posteriori ephemeris generation: all
          intermediate results are stored during propagation and provided back to the application
          which can navigate at will through them, effectively using the propagated orbit as if
          it was analytical model, even if it really is a numerically propagated one, which
          is ideal for search and iterative algorithms
        * several step handlers can be used simultaneously, so it is possible to have a fine
          grained fixed time step to log state in a huge file, and have at the same time a
          coarse grained time step to display progress for user at a more human-friendly rate,
          this feature can also be used for debugging purpose, by setting up a temporary
          step handler alongside the operational ones
    * handling of discrete events during integration
      (models changes, G-stop, simple notifications ...)
    * predefined discrete events
        * eclipse (both umbra and penumbra)
        * ascending and descending node crossing

          (with customizable threshold angle)
        * angular separation thresholds crossing between spacecraft and a beacon (typically the Sun)
          as seen from an observer (typically a ground station)
        * raising/setting with respect to a ground location
          (with customizable triggering elevation and ground mask, optionally considering refraction)

    * events filtering based on their direction (for example to detect
      only eclipse entries and not eclipse exits)

      example to detect events only during selected orbits and not others)

      simultaneously throughout propagation

## Free software

Orekit is freely available both in source and binary formats, with all related
documentation and tests.

It is distributed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](./licenses.html). This
is a well known business-friendly license. This means anybody can use it to build
any application, free or not. There are no strings attached to your own code.

Everybody is encouraged to use Orekit as a common low level layer to improve
interoperability in space systems.

## Maintained library

Orekit has been in development since 2002 inside [CS GROUP](https://www.csgroup.eu/)
and is still used and maintained by its
experts and an open community. It is ruled by a meritocratic governance
model and the Project Management Committee involves actors from
industry (CS, Thales Alenia Space, Applied Defense Solutions), research
(Naval Research Laboratory), agencies (European Space Operations Centre,
European Space Research and Technology Centre) and academics (University
at Buffalo, Institut National SupÃ©rieur de l'AÃ©ronautique et de l'Espace - Sup'AÃ©ro).

Orekit has already been successfully used during the real time monitoring of the rendez-vous
phase between the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the International Space Station (ISS)
by the Centre National d'Ãtudes Spatiales (CNES, the French space agency) and European Space
Agency (ESA).

Orekit has been selected in early 2011 by CNES to be the basis of its next generation space
flight dynamics systems, including operational systems, study systems and mission analysis
systems.

It has been used in numerous studies and for operational systems among the world.
