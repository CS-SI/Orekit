# Overview

  OREKIT (ORbits Extrapolation KIT) is a free low-level space dynamics library
  written in Java.

  It provides basic elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames ...) and
  various algorithms to handle them (conversions, analytical and numerical
  propagation, pointing ...).

## Features

  * Time

    * high accuracy absolute dates
    * time scales (TAI, UTC, UT1, GPS, TT, TCG, TDB, TCB, GMST, GST, GLONASS, QZSS, BDT, IRNSS ...)
    * transparent handling of leap seconds

  * Geometry

    * frames hierarchy supporting fixed and time-dependent
      (or telemetry-dependent) frames
    * predefined frames (EME2000/J2000, ICRF, GCRF, all ITRF from 1988 to 2014
      and intermediate frames, TOD, MOD, GTOD and TOD frames, Veis, topocentric, tnw and qsw
      local orbital frames, Moon, Sun, planets, solar system barycenter,
      Earth-Moon barycenter, ecliptic)
    * user extensible (used operationally in real time with a set of about 60 frames on
      several spacecraft)
    * transparent handling of IERS Earth Orientation Parameters (for both new CIO-based frames
      following IERS 2010 conventions and old equinox-based frames)
    * transparent handling of JPL DE 4xx (405, 406 and more recent) and INPOP ephemerides
    * transforms including kinematic combination effects
    * composite transforms reduction and caching for efficiency
    * extensible central body shapes models (with predefined spherical and ellipsoidic shapes)
    * Cartesian and geodesic coordinates, kinematics
    * Computation of Dilution Of Precision (DOP) with respect to GNSS constellations

  * Spacecraft state

    * Cartesian, elliptical Keplerian, circular and equinoctial parameters, with non-Keplerian
      derivatives if available
    * Two-Line Elements
    * transparent conversion between all parameters
    * automatic binding with frames
    * attitude state and derivative
    * Jacobians
    * mass management
    * user-defined associated state
      (for example battery status, or higher order derivatives, or anything else)

  * Maneuvers

    * analytical models for small maneuvers without propagation
    * impulse maneuvers for any propagator type
    * continuous maneuvers for numerical propagator type

  * Propagation

    * analytical propagation models
      (Kepler, Eckstein-Heschler, SDP4/SGP4 with 2006 corrections)
    * numerical propagators

      * central attraction
      * gravity models including time-dependent like trends and pulsations
        (automatic reading of ICGEM (new Eigen models), SHM (old Eigen models),
        EGM and GRGS gravity field files formats, even compressed)
      * atmospheric drag
      * third body attraction (with data for Sun, Moon and all solar systems planets)
      * radiation pressure with eclipses
      * solid tides, with or without solid pole tide
      * ocean tides, with or without ocean pole tide
      * general relativity
      * multiple maneuvers
      * state of the art ODE integrators (adaptive stepsize with error control,
        continuous output, switching functions, G-stop, step normalization ...)
      * computation of Jacobians with respect to orbital parameters and selected
        force models parameters
      * serialization mechanism to store complete results on persistent storage for
        later use

    * semi-analytical propagation model (DSST) with customizable force models
    * tabulated ephemerides

      * file based
      * memory based
      * integration based

    * specialized GPS propagation, using SEM or YUMA files
    * Taylor-algebra (or any other real field) version of most of the above propagators,
        with all force models, events detection, orbits types, coordinates types and frames
        allowing high order uncertainties and derivatives computation or very fast Monte-Carlo
        analyzes
    * unified interface above analytical/numerical/tabulated propagators for easy
      switch from coarse analysis to fine simulation with one line change
    * all propagators can be used in several different modes

      * slave mode: propagator is driven by calling application
      * master mode: propagator drives application callback functions
      * ephemeris generation mode: all intermediate results are stored during
        propagation and provided back to the application which can navigate at will
        through them, effectively using the propagated orbit as if it was an
        analytical model, even if it really is a numerically propagated one, which
        is ideal for search and iterative algorithms

      reverting to solar pointing mode a few minutes after eclipse exit)
    * events filtering based on their direction (for example to detect
      only eclipse entries and not eclipse exits)

## Free software

Orekit is freely available both in source and binary formats, with all related
documentation and tests.

It is distributed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](./licenses.html). This
is a well known business-friendly license. This means anybody can use it to build
any application, free or not. There are no strings attached to your own code.

Everybody is encouraged to use Orekit as a common low level layer to improve
interoperability in space systems.

## Maintained library

Orekit has been in development since 2002 inside [CS SystÃ¨mes
d'Information](http://www.c-s.fr/) and is still used and maintained by its
experts and an open community. It is ruled by a meritocratic governance
model and the Project Management Committee involves actors from
industry (CS, Thales Alenia Space, Applied Defense Solutions), research
(Naval Research Laboratory), agencies (European Space Operations Centre,
European Space Research and Technology Centre) and academics (University
at Buffalo, Institut National SupÃ©rieur de l'AÃ©ronautique et de l'Espace - Sup'AÃ©ro).

Orekit has already been successfully used during the real time monitoring of the rendez-vous
phase between the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the International Space Station (ISS)
by the Centre National d'Ãtudes Spatiales (CNES, the French space agency) and European Space
Agency (ESA).

Orekit has been selected in early 2011 by CNES to be the basis of its next generation space
flight dynamics systems, including operational systems, study systems and mission analysis
systems.

It has been used in numerous studies and for operational systems among the world.
