# Overview

  OREKIT (ORbits Extrapolation KIT) is a free low-level space dynamics library
  written in Java.

  It provides basic elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames ...) and
  various algorithms to handle them (conversions, analytical and numerical
  propagation, pointing ...).

    * numerical propagators
        * central attraction
        * gravity models including time-dependent like trends and pulsations
          (automatic reading of ICGEM (new Eigen models), SHM (old Eigen models),
          EGM and GRGS gravity field files formats, even compressed)
        * atmospheric drag
        * third body attraction (with data for Sun, Moon and all solar systems planets)

          force models parameters

        * memory based
        * integration based
    * Taylor-algebra (or any other real field) version of most of the above propagators,
        with all force models, events detection, orbits types, coordinates types and frames
        allowing high order uncertainties and derivatives computation or very fast Monte-Carlo
        analyzes
    * unified interface above analytical/numerical/tabulated propagators for easy
      switch from coarse analysis to fine simulation with one line change
    * all propagators can manage the time loop by themselves and handle callback
      functions (called step handlers) from the calling application at each time step.
        * step handlers can be called at discrete time at regular time steps, which are
          independent of propagator time steps
        * step handlers can be called with interpolators valid throughout one propagator
          time step, which can have varying sizes
        * step handlers can be switched off completely, when only final state is desired
        * special step handlers are provided for a posteriori ephemeris generation: all
          intermediate results are stored during propagation and provided back to the application
          which can navigate at will through them, effectively using the propagated orbit as if
          it was analytical model, even if it really is a numerically propagated one, which
          is ideal for search and iterative algorithms
        * several step handlers can be used simultaneously, so it is possible to have a fine
          grained fixed time step to log state in a huge file, and have at the same time a
          coarse grained time step to display progress for user at a more human-friendly rate,
          this feature can also be used for debugging purpose, by setting up a temporary
          step handler alongside the operational ones
    * handling of discrete events during integration
      (models changes, G-stop, simple notifications ...)
    * predefined discrete events
        * eclipse (both umbra and penumbra)
        * ascending and descending node crossing
        * apogee and perigee crossing
        * alignment with some body in the orbital plane
          (with customizable threshold angle)
        * angular separation thresholds crossing between spacecraft and a beacon (typically the Sun)
          as seen from an observer (typically a ground station)
        * raising/setting with respect to a ground location
          (with customizable triggering elevation and ground mask, optionally considering refraction)
        * date and on-the-fly resetting countdown
        * date interval with parameter-driven boundaries
        * latitude, longitude, altitude crossing
        * latitude, longitude extremum
        * elevation extremum

      solar pointing mode to something else a few minutes before eclipse entry and
      reverting to solar pointing mode a few minutes after eclipse exit)

      only eclipse entries and not eclipse exits)
    * events filtering  based on an external enabling function (for
      example to detect events only during selected orbits and not others)

       simultaneously throughout propagation

## Maintained library

Orekit has been in development since 2002 inside [CS GROUP](http://www.c-s.fr/)
and is still used and maintained by its
experts and an open community. It is ruled by a meritocratic governance
model and the Project Management Committee involves actors from
industry (CS, Thales Alenia Space, Applied Defense Solutions), research
(Naval Research Laboratory), agencies (European Space Operations Centre,
European Space Research and Technology Centre) and academics (University
at Buffalo, Institut National SupÃ©rieur de l'AÃ©ronautique et de l'Espace - Sup'AÃ©ro).

Orekit has already been successfully used during the real time monitoring of the rendez-vous
phase between the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the International Space Station (ISS)
by the Centre National d'Ãtudes Spatiales (CNES, the French space agency) and European Space
Agency (ESA).

Orekit has been selected in early 2011 by CNES to be the basis of its next generation space
flight dynamics systems, including operational systems, study systems and mission analysis
systems.

It has been used in numerous studies and for operational systems among the world.
