        // looking in the reference data file original-eclips/beta-crossing-GLONASS.txt,
        // one can see that the axis at line 6 is about (1.3069, 0.7310, -0.7609). The yaw
        // angle extracted from this wrong vector and written as the last field in the same
        // line reads 92.6599°, whereas Orekit value is 94.4594°. However, looking
        // at the log from the original routine, we get:
        // R          45   103443.31500000000        179.97115230838418        94.470693723018371 ...

        // As the testOriginal...() series of tests explicitly do *not* patch the original routine
        // at all, it was not possible to output the internal phi variable to write reference
        // data properly. We also decided to not edit the file to set the correct angle value,
        // as this would imply cheating on the reference
        // As a conclusion, we consider here that the reference output is wrong and that
        // Orekit behavior is correct, so we increased the threshold so the test pass,
        // and wrote this big comment to explain the situation
