        // the output of the routine is limited to the x-sat vector, the yaw angle itself
        // is not output. However, in some cases the x-sat vector is not normalized at all.
        // looking in the reference data file original-eclips/beta-crossing-BLOCK-IIA.txt,
        // one can see that the axis at line 9 is about (-11.3028, -4.4295, -8.8996). The
        // yaw angle extracted from this wrong vector and written as the last field in the
        // same line reads 86.4797°, whereas Orekit value is 21.2256°. However, looking
        // at the log from the original routine, we get:
        // S           8   494903.73200000002        179.46493246830718        22.444691559239963 ...
        // so we see that the yaw value is 22.4447°, very close to Orekit value.
        // As the testOriginal...() series of tests explicitly do *not* patch the original routine
        // at all, it was not possible to output the internal phi variable to write reference
        // data properly. We also decided to not edit the file to set the correct angle value,
        // as this would imply cheating on the reference
        // This point however does not explain the 2.13 radians error. The 2.13 radians comes
        // from the following point. Here, the original eclips considers the turn has already
        // converged and it jump backs to nominal attitude. The reason is another probable
        // bug in original eclips (which was addressed by our patch number 04). As the Sun
        // crosses plane, the sign of beta changes and the sign of nominal yaw changes. However,
        // the sign of the *linear* yaw is normalized according to the initial beta (betaini),
        // not to the current beta. Near the end of the computation, a test (PHI/YANGLE).LT.0.d0
        // fails and the attitude is set back to nominal, despite it should not (the yaw angle
        // should be about 58.4° and jumps directly to 180.5°).
        // As a conclusion, we consider here that the reference output is wrong and that
        // Orekit behavior is correct, so we increased the threshold so the test pass,
        // and wrote this big comment to explain the situation
