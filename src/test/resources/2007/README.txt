The files in this directory are test files only.
They should NOT be used for anything but test purposes.

The Chebyshev coefficients are real ones extracted from the official
JPL DE 440 ephemerides, but the headers have been
edited and the files have been truncated for test purposes.

The files ranges are as follows:
