#   - edit it to store their proxy settings and their credentials to BKG ntrip casters
#   - secure it so it is only readable by owner
# if the metric-test-auth.properties file exists but is either group or world readable,
# the tests will intentionally fail (this is to avoid users letting a file with
# sensitive passwords lying around unprotected)
